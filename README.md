## Thesis Guidance

University regulations are found [here](https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/academic/exams/research?wssl=1), with MSD specific guidance available as a [Canvas course](https://canvas.ox.ac.uk/courses/22105). Key points include

- Examiner appointment
    - General advice: "You should liaise with your supervisor regarding the selection of your proposed examiners. It is usual for supervisors to invite the proposed examiners informally, and confirm their willingness to act, before the submission of the Application for Appointment of Examiners (GSO.3) form."
    - MSD specific advice on examiner appointment (from Canvas): "Supervisors are asked to suggest the names of two internal and external examiners to the Medical Sciences Board and, as far as possible, to consult with the student to check if he or she has any reasonable objection to any of those proposed."
    - MSD: "Transfer/confirmation assessors can subsequently be invited as degree examiners for the student provided they have not given further assistance to the student between transfer/confirmation of status and final submission of the thesis"
    - MSD: **"Where a department uses thesis committees, a thesis committee member should not serve as an internal examiner"**
    - After informally confirming the examiners (one external and one internal), the [GSO.3](https://www.evision.ox.ac.uk/) form must be completed on eVision.

- Timeline 
    - General: "It is strongly recommended that you *complete your section of the GSO.3 form four-to-six weeks prior to submitting your thesis*. This is to allow time for your nominated examiners to be approved, and to accept formal invitations issued by the Research Degrees Team". MSD: "Ideally at least 6 weeks before your thesis (DPhil or MSc) is to be submitted for examination, you should fill in a GSO.3 form"
    - Thesis title can be updated when submitting the GSO.3 form
    - "...there should be at least four full weeks between examiners receiving your thesis and the viva being held"
    - Both general and MSD advice suggest informally discussing which examiners to invite between the candidate and supervisors, and inviting the examiners informally before GSO.3 submission
    - You can apply to have your viva examination before a certain date, but this "...can not be earlier than one calendar month after the date on which the thesis is received at the Examination Schools, or after the date on which the examiners have agreed to act, whichever is later"
    - It is the responsibility of the internal examiner to make the arrangements for the viva date (within one month of receiving the thesis), otherwise the Research Degrees Team will chase with the examiner
    - The average time between submission of thesis and viva is 8 weeks
- Thesis
    - Submission is via [Student Self Service](https://evision.ox.ac.uk/) (see [quick reference guide](https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/QRG%20-%20Student%20Thesis%20Submission.pdf))
    - Regarding style and format of thesis - general information is available in [Notes of Guidance for Research Examinations - GSO.20a](https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/GSO.20a.pdf), and [MSD specific advice](https://examregs.admin.ox.ac.uk/Regulation?code=rditmedisciedivi&srchYear=2024&srchTerm=1&year=2024&term=1), which links to the [Graduate School Canvas](https://canvas.ox.ac.uk/courses/22105)
    - General preparation notes from GSO.20a:
        - The thesis must be word-processed with a margin of 3 to 3.5 cm on the left-hand edge of each page
        - The main text should be double-spaced with quotations and footnotes in single spacing
        - Double spacing should be taken to mean a distance of about 0.33 inch or 8 mm between successive lines of text
        - Text should be typed using an easily readable font, with a minimum font size of 11 pt
        - Footnotes should be font size 10 pt
        - Candidates should state the approximate number of words in their thesis
        - The pages of the thesis must be numbered
        - "The **abstract** of the thesis should concisely summarise its scope and principal arguments, in about 300 words. It should be placed within the thesis, generally immediately following the Table of Contents. When the examination is completed, the abstract should be included in the library copy of their thesis."
    - MSD notes:
        - "You must state the approximate number of words in your thesis"
        - Word limit (exclusive of bibliography, appendices, diagrams and tables): 50,000
        - Note on AI use: "Please note that AI can only be used within assessments where specific prior authorisation has been given, or when technology that uses AI has been agreed as reasonable adjustment for a student’s disability (such as voice recognition software for transcriptions, or spelling and grammar checkers)"
        - Reuse of published material: this is fine, but you need to fully acknowledge that parts of the thesis have been published, and indicate which parts. This should be documented in the acknowledgements section, and with references/footnotes in the relevant sections. 
        - Reuse of published material: "You should get written confirmation from your co-authors/supervisor that you wrote/produced the material and permission from them to reuse parts in your thesis"
        - Digital copy only
- Viva
  
    - You are expected to wear academic dress: subfusc and gown unless the viva is performed remotely
    - Regarding remote vivas: applications should be made to the 'relevant' board via the Director of Graduate Studies with the following information
        - reasons for the request and why attendance in person is not possible
        - assurance that person making the request will have access to suitable space, equipment, internet connection, and software to facilitate a remote viva
    - A copy of the thesis must be brought to the examination (can be digital or paper copy)
    - Result of the viva can be
        - *Minor corrections*: informed within 2 weeks of viva (usually at the time of examination of 'shortly after'), and completed within 1 month of being issued (changing to two months after 12th October 2025)
        - *Major corrections*: may require a further viva to confirm the nature of corrections, and must be completed within 6 months of being issued
    - Any re-submissions must be accompanied by a report with a limit of 1000 words (MSD)
    - A digital copy of the thesis must be submitted to the [Oxford University Research Archive](https://ora.ox.ac.uk)
