\section{Descriptive Analysis}

A total of 2,095 patients from nine East African studies were identified after applying the eligibility criteria to the IDDO VL data platform\cite{hailu2010,khalil2014,mbui2019,musa2010,musa2012,ritmeijer2001,ritmeijer2006,veeken2000,wasunna2016}. At the participant selection stage, 370 participants (13.5\%, 370/2749) were excluded due to either having a positive HIV test, or lacking a HIV test and recruiting from a site outside of Sudan. 323 (11.7\%, 323/2749) participants were excluded due to not achieving initial cure. A flow-diagram is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:ea_flow_diagram}.

\subsection{Study Characteristics}

Important study characteristics are presented in Table~\ref{tab:ea_study}.

A median of 138 patients per contributed study were included in model development, ranging from 29 to 638 patients (IQR: 92 to 289 patients). Five studies recruited from sites across multiple countries (1,186 [57.8\%] patients)\cite{hailu2010,khalil2014,mbui2019,musa2012,wasunna2016}, and the remaining four studies recruited from site(s) in single countries, including Sudan (two studies, 505 [24.6\%] patients)\cite{musa2010,veeken2000} and Ethiopia (two studies 360 [17.6\%] patients)\cite{ritmeijer2006,ritmeijer2001}. A full breakdown of patients by country is included in Section~\ref{sec:pt-char} below.

The majority of studies were sponsored by DND\textit{i} and conducted across the Leishmaniasis East Africa Platform (LEAP) (six studies, 1,226 [59.8\%] patients, conducted 2004 to 2016). These included LEAP~0104 \textemdash\ a large pivotal study comparing short course SSG \& paromomycin to SSG or paromomycin monotherapy (three contributed studies, 967 [47.1\%] patients)\cite{hailu2010,musa2010,musa2012}. LEAP~0106 was a smaller study with the aim of identifying the minimum safe and effective dose of liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB) (one study, 92 [4.5\%] patients)\cite{khalil2014}. LEAP~0208 compared miltefosine with two different combination therapies (LAMB + miltefosine, LAMB + SSG) (138 [6.7\%] patients)\cite{wasunna2016}, and LEAP~0714 was a smaller allometric dosing study of miltefosine in paediatric patients (29 [1.4\%] patients)\cite{mbui2019}.

The remaining studies were led by MSF and conducted between 1998 and 2005, including two studies comparing generic and branded SSG (577 [28.1\%] patients)\cite{ritmeijer2001,veeken2000}, and a further study comparing SSG and miltefosine (248 [12.1\%] patients)\cite{ritmeijer2006}.

\subsubsection{Study Design and Treatment Arms}

All studies bar one allocated patients to more than one treatment arm (eight studies, 2,022 [98.6\%] patients)\cite{hailu2010,musa2010,musa2012,khalil2014,ritmeijer2006,ritmeijer2001,veeken2000,wasunna2016}. Six studies randomly allocated patients to treatment arms (1,445 [70.5\%] patients)\cite{hailu2010,khalil2014,musa2010,musa2012,ritmeijer2006,wasunna2016} and two studies were pseudo-randomised\footnote{Based on whether the direct agglutination test (DAT) batch number was odd or even.} (577 [28.1\%] patients)\cite{ritmeijer2001,veeken2000}. Three studies were described by the authors as Phase 2 trials (207 [10.1\%] patients)\cite{mbui2019,musa2010,wasunna2016}.

Treatment arms are summarised in Figure~\ref{fig:ea_treat}. Treatment allocations at the patient level are described further in Section~\ref{sec:ea_cat_var}.

\subsubsection{Study Eligibility Criteria}

All but two studies described age limits in their inclusion criteria\cite{hailu2010,khalil2014,mbui2019,musa2010,musa2012,ritmeijer2006,wasunna2016}. Two studies specified lower age limits only ($\geq$~15 years in one study; 248 [12.1\%] patients, and $\geq$~4 years in a further study; 92 [4.5\%] patients). Three studies limited inclusion to patients between 4 and 60 years (967 [47.1\%] patients)\cite{musa2010,musa2012,hailu2010}, and one study limited inclusion to patients between 7 and 60 years (138 [6.7\%] patients)\cite{wasunna2016}. One study recruited children between 4 and 12 years (29 [1.4\%] patients)\cite{mbui2019}.

Six studies (all DND\textit{i}, 1,226 [59.8\%] patients) reported exclusion criteria based on platelet count ($\geq$~40~$\times$10$^9$/L) and haemoglobin ($\geq$~40~g/L in one study, 92 [4.4\%] patients\cite{khalil2014}, and $\geq$~50~g/L in five studies, 1,134 [55.2\%] patients\cite{hailu2010,mbui2019,musa2010,musa2012,wasunna2016}). Four studies described excluding patients with `severe' VL (1,048 [51.1\%] patients)\cite{hailu2010,khalil2014,mbui2019,musa2012}, and four studies excluded patients based on malnutrition severity (three studies excluded patients with severe protein and/or caloric malnutrition; 467 [22.8\%] patients\cite{hailu2010,musa2010,wasunna2016}, and one study excluded children with weight-for-height or BMI-for-age z-scores < -3; 29 [1.4\%] patients\cite{mbui2019}). Seven studies (1,474 [71.9\%] patients) excluded patients with severe concomitant illness and/or co-infection\cite{hailu2010,khalil2014,mbui2019,musa2010,musa2012,ritmeijer2006,wasunna2016}.

Four studies (299 [14.6\%] patients) required a negative HIV test as a pre-requisite for inclusion\cite{wasunna2016,musa2010,mbui2019,khalil2014}. The remaining studies either did not report HIV testing or HIV-related exclusion criteria (one study, 465 [22.7\%] patients)\cite{veeken2000}, or permitted the inclusion of patients with VL/HIV co-infection (with variable testing strategies, 4 studies, 1,019 [49.7\%] patients)\cite{hailu2010,musa2012,ritmeijer2001,ritmeijer2006}.

Of the eight studies that included adults (2,022 [98.6\%] patients), four studies (1059/2022 [52.4\%] patients) excluded women who were pregnant or lactating\cite{musa2010,musa2012,hailu2010,khalil2014}, one study excluded women of child-bearing age (138/2022 [6.8\%] patients)\cite{wasunna2016}, one study excluded all female patients regardless of age (248/2022 [12.3\%] patients)\cite{ritmeijer2006},\footnote{Due to concern re: teratogenicity of miltefosine.} and two studies did not report excluding women based on pregnancy or lactating status(577/2051 [28.1\%] patients)\cite{ritmeijer2001,ritmeijer2006}.

Patients with prior VL treatment were excluded in seven studies; either within 6 months in five studies (1,088 [53.0\%] patients)\cite{hailu2010,khalil2014,mbui2019,musa2010,musa2012}, or at any prior time point in two studies (577 [28.1\%] patients)\cite{veeken2000,ritmeijer2001}.

Full study-specific eligibility criteria can be found in the \href{https://github.com/jpwil/dphil}{Supplementary Material}.

\subsubsection{Diagnostic Criteria}

A positive tissue aspirate was required for VL confirmation in all six DND\textit{i} studies (1,226 [59.8\%] patients), with tissue type including bone, spleen, or lymph node, depending on practice at the recruiting site. All studies required clinical evidence of VL, although the exact working varied across studies (presented in \href{https://github.com/jpwil/dphil}{Supplementary Material}). The three earlier MSF studies (825 [40.2\%] patients)\cite{veeken2000,ritmeijer2006,ritmeijer2001} confirmed VL with a DAT (titre $\geq$~1:6400), with borderline titres (1:8000--1:3200) requiring a confirmatory tissue aspirate. One study (112 [5.5\%] patients)reported some patients receiving a VL diagnosis on clinical grounds due to occasional disruption to the supply of DAT kits\cite{ritmeijer2001}.

\subsubsection{Relapse}

Relapse was directly defined in two studies (288 [14.0\%] patients)\cite{ritmeijer2006,musa2010}, and could be inferred in the remaining studies through definitions of definite cure, initial cure, and treatment failure. All relapse cases were confirmed with a tissue aspirate, with aspirate results available in the contributed IPD. All studies adopted an active follow-up strategy following test-of-cure. However, loss-to-follow-up rates varied across studies, with particularly high rates seen in the earlier pragmatic MSF studies\cite{veeken2000,ritmeijer2006,ritmeijer2001}. Four studies (1,059 [51.6\%] patients)\cite{hailu2010,khalil2014,musa2010,musa2012} performed routine 6 month aspirates.

\subsubsection{Initial Cure}

Definitions of initial cure varied considerably across studies, and are presented in the \href{https://github.com/jpwil/dphil}{Supplementary Material}. In the six DND\textit{i} studies, test-of-cure occurred at variable time points within 31 days of treatment initiation, depending on the treatment arm (range 18--31 days)\cite{hailu2010,mbui2019,musa2010,musa2012,wasunna2016,khalil2014}. In the three MSF studies, treatment was extended with SSG until two consecutive tests-of-cure were negative\cite{veeken2000,ritmeijer2006,ritmeijer2001}. Routine aspirates were performed in all studies, although two studies explicitly stated that aspirates were only performed in the presence of palpable splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy (360 [17.6\%] patients)\cite{ritmeijer2006,ritmeijer2001}.

In five studies (1,197 [58.4\%] patients), those showing clinical improvement despite a \textit{positive} initial test-of-cure aspirate, regardless of parasite grade, were considered to have failed the outcome of initial cure\cite{wasunna2016,musa2012,musa2010,khalil2014,hailu2010}. However, these patients remained in the study and could subsequently achieve definite cure at 6 months if clinical symptoms did not recur and a subsequent (e.g. 3 or 6 month) aspirate were negative. These patients, sometimes referred to as `slow-responders', were included in model development despite not meeting the study definition of initial cure.

\subsection{Patient Characteristics\label{sec:pt-char}}

Overall (marginal) distributions of categorical and continuous variables are tabulated in Tables~\ref{tab:ea_categorical} and~\ref{tab:ea_continuous}, respectively. These distributions are also displayed graphically in Figure~\ref{fig:ea_cat_comb} for bar charts of categorical variables, and Figures~\ref{fig:ea_pooled_dist_cont1} and~\ref{fig:ea_pooled_dist_cont1} for histograms of non-laboratory and laboratory variables, respectively. Study-specific distributions are presented for age, sex, and relapse in Figure~\ref{fig:ea_main_dist}. In the Appendix, study-specific distributions of all categorical and continuous variables are presented in Figures~\ref{fig:ea_comb_dist_cat} and~\ref{fig:ea_age_comb}--\ref{fig:ea_cr_log_comb}, respectively.

Patient numbers and proportions presented in this section exclude missing data. See Section \ref{sec:ea_missing_data} for further information on missing data.

\subsubsection{Categorical Variables\label{sec:ea_cat_var}}

Almost three quarters of patients (1,519 [74.1\%]) were male, ranging from 59.1\%\cite{veeken2000} to 100\%\cite{ritmeijer2006} at the study level.

Relapse within 6 months was reported in 99 (4.8\%) patients overall, and varying considerably at the study level from 0.9\%\cite{ritmeijer2001,veeken2000} to 20\%\cite{musa2010}.

As defined in Section~\ref{sec:malnutrition}, almost a quarter of all patients were severely malnourished (509 [24.9\% patients]). Moderate malnutrition affected 800 (39.1\%) patients, and 735 (36.0\%) had mild/normal malnutrition. Higher rates of severe malnutrition were seen in the two early MSF studies conducted in the late 1990s (33.1\%)\cite{veeken2000,ritmeijer2001} (presented in Appendix~Figure~\ref{fig:ea_comb_dist_cat}).

Severe anaemia affected 999 (48.8\%) of patients overall.

A variety of treatment regimens were investigated across the studies. At the patient level, the single most common drug used was SSG (either generic or branded) \textemdash\ used as monotherapy in 1,048 (51.1\%) patients, or as part of combination therapy with paromomycin or LAMB in 326 (15.9\%) and 47 (2.2\%) patients, respectively. The second most frequently used drug was paromomycin (received by 623 [30.3\%] of patients overall) followed by LAMB (185 [9.1\%] patients) and miltefosine (195 [9.5\%] patients). The full range of treatment regimens, including dosing, are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:ea_treat}.

Parasite grade ranged from 1$+$ to 6$+$, with 1$+$ being the most common (511 [36.8\%] patients who underwent tissue aspirate), followed by 2$+$ (237 [17.1\%] patients), and decreasing to 77 (5.5\%) patients with 6$+$. Tissue aspirate source was not reported in 702 (50.5\%) of patients overall. Where reported, 393 (29.1\%) were from the spleen, 163 (12.1\%) were from lymph nodes, and 131 (9.7\%) from bone marrow.

Approximately half of all patients were recruited from sites in Sudan (1,104 [53.8\%] patients), followed by Ethiopia (695 [27.8\%] patients), Kenya (227 [11.1\%]), and Uganda (25 [1.2\%] patients).

\subsubsection{Continuous Variables}

The median age was 14 years, ranging from 1 to 60 years (IQR: 9 to 22 years). Age distributions by study are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:ea_main_dist}, showing right-skewed distributions reflecting the study specific age inclusion criteria. 129 (6.3\%) of patients were under 5 years at the time of recruitment.

In adults the median BMI was 17.6~m/kg$^2$ (IQR: 16.3 to 18.7~m/kg$^2$). In children ($\geq$~5 and $<$~19 years), the median BMI-for-age z-score was -2.32 (IQR: -3.10 to -1.50), and in younger children ($<$~5 years) the median weight-for-height z-score was -2.36 (IQR: -3.12 to -1.58) (data available for 129 patients).

The median spleen size was 8~cm (IQR: 5 to 11~cm), and ranged from 0 to 30~cm. Where measured, 138 (6.9\%) patients had non-palpable spleens.

The median duration of fever prior to recruitment was 40 days (IQR: 25 to 91 days), and ranging from 3 to 761~days.

Distributions of laboratory results are presented in Table~\ref{tab:ea_continuous} and Figure~\ref{fig:ea_pooled_dist_cont1}.

A correlation matrix showing associations between continuous variables is presented in Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:ea_cont_cont}, and between continuous and categorical variables in Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:ea_cont_cat}. These correlations are considered further in the Discussion section.

\subsection{Univariable Associations}

Unadjusted relationships between variables (including all candidate predictors, excluding missing data) and relapse risk are presented both in tabular form (Tables~\ref{tab:ea_categorical}, \ref{tab:ea_continuous}) and visually alongside their distributions (Figure~\ref{fig:ea_cat_comb} for categorical variables, and Figures~\ref{fig:ea_pooled_dist_cont1} and \ref{fig:ea_pooled_dist_cont2} for non-laboratory and laboratory variables, respectively). Predictor-outcome relationships are presented on the log-odds (logit) scale for continuous candidate predictors in Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:ea_logodds}.

On review of the associations between the categorical predictors and relapse risk (upper facet row, Figure~\ref{fig:ea_cat_comb}), clear trends were seen for malnutrition, anaemia, and parasite grade. Increased relapse risk was seen with higher malnutrition severity, ranging from approximately 3.5\% for mild/normal to 6.5\% for severe categories. Perhaps more marked, with non-overlying confidence intervals, was the increased relapse risk seen in the severe anaemia group compared to the non-severe anaemia group, from approximately 3\% to 6.5\%. For relapse cases, 65/99 (65.7\%) had severe anaemia, compared to 476/1946 (24.5\%) of final cure cases (excluding missing data).

With parasite grade, a substantial increase in relapse risk was seen for patients with a 6$+$ grade compared to <~6$+$ grades, increasing from approximately 5--7.5\% to over 20\%. Among relapse cases, 17/92 (18.5\%) of patients had a 6$+$ grade aspirate, compared to 60/1297 (4.6\%) of the final cure cases (after excluding missing data).

Clear trends were observed between all non-laboratory continuous variables and relapse risk (Figure~\ref{fig:ea_pooled_dist_cont1}). For age, relapse risk followed a non-linear trend, peaking at approximately 10~years and decreasing to a nadir in the early 20s. Fluctuations in risk with height and weight were also noted, mirroring the relationship between age and relapse. Less marked downward trends between relapse risk and spleen size and fever duration were observed.

Among the laboratory continuous variables (Figure~\ref{fig:ea_pooled_dist_cont2}), a pronounced inverse relationship between relapse risk and haemoglobin is seen, concordant with the aforementioned increased risk seen in patients with severe vs. non-severe anaemia. Appreciable upwards trends between relapse risk and both white blood cell count and platelets are also seen, although the overall significance is unclear.

A correlation matrix showing associations between continuous variables is presented in Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:ea_cont_cont}, and between continuous and categorical variables in Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:ea_cont_cat}. These correlations are considered further in the Discussion section.

\subsection{\label{sec:ea_missing_data}Missing Data}

Missingness was common, and affecting one or more candidate predictors in 1,168 (56.9\%) patients. 215 (10.5\%) patients were missing 1 candidate predictor exactly. As appreciated from Figure~\ref{fig:ea_missing_summary}, the majority of missingness originated from the earlier MSF studies, where ALT, platelets, WBC, creatinine, and parasite grade were not routinely collected, resulting in almost a third of all patients (634 [30.9\%] patients) missing 5 candidate predictors.

Across all studies, ALT, platelets, WBC, and creatinine were missing in between 40 and 45\% of all patients. Parasite grade was missing for approximately one third of the total cohort (662 [32.3\%] of patients).

\subsubsection{Multiple Imputation}

Diagnostic plots for the 30 imputed datasets are available in the \href{https://github.com/jpwil/dphil}{Supplementary Material}. On review of the trace plots, there was good evidence for convergence of the imputation model. Density and scatter plots revealed overall good correlation between the imputed and original variables.

\section{Model Results}

East African IPD were used to develop two separate prediction models; one including parasite grade as a candidate predictor, and one exclude parasite grade.

\subsection{Model Specification and Coefficient Estimates}

Final (retained) predictors across both models are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:ea_var_forest_combined}. Full specification of the final models, including intercept terms, p-values, and predictor transformations, are presented in Appendix Tables~\ref{tab:ea_model_coeff_with_pg} and \ref{tab:ea_model_coeff_without_pg}.
