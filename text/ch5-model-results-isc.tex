\section{Descriptive Analysis}

On application of the eligibility criteria to the IDDO VL data platform, a total of 19 studies and 4,599 patients were selected for inclusion\cite{bhattacharya2007,chakraborty2008,das2009,koirala2003,pandey2016,pandey2017,rijal2003,rijal2010a,rijal2010b,sundar2007a,sundar2008,sundar2008B,sundar2009,sundar2010,sundar2011,sundar2012,sundar2014,sundar2015,sundar2019}. At the participant selection stage, 27 participants (0.6\%, 27/4860) were excluded due to having a positive HIV test, and 201 (4.1\%, 201/4860) were excluded due to not achieving initial cure. A flow diagram is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:isc_flow_diagram}.

\subsection{Study Characteristics}

Key characteristics of the 19 included studies are presented in Table~\ref{tab:isc_study}.

A median of 144 patients were recruited in each study, ranging from 6 to 928 patients (IQR: 87 to 330 patients). Patients were recruited between 2000 and 2017 from sites in India (15 studies, 4,171 [90.7\%] patients)\cite{bhattacharya2007,chakraborty2008, das2009,pandey2016,pandey2017,sundar2007a,sundar2008,sundar2008B,sundar2009,sundar2010,sundar2011,sundar2012,sundar2014,sundar2015,sundar2019} and Nepal (4 studies, 428 [9.3\%] patients)\cite{rijal2003, rijal2010a, rijal2010b,koirala2003}. All Indian studies recruited patients from the state of Bihar in northeastern India, with the majority of studies led by investigators from either a government referral hospital in Patna (Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences: RMRIMS) (4 studies, 1,125 [24.5\%] patients)\cite{bhattacharya2007, das2009,pandey2016,pandey2017}, or a private research facility in Muzaffarpur (Kala-azar Medical Research Centre: KAMRC) (9 studies, 2,652 [57.7\%] patients)\cite{chakraborty2008,sundar2008,sundar2008B,sundar2009,sundar2010,sundar2011,sundar2012,sundar2015,sundar2019}. All Nepalese studies were led by investigators based at the B.P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, a health sciences university in the city of Dharan, Koshi Province, eastern Nepal.

\subsubsection{Study Design and Treatment Arms}

% for R: s <- c("das2009" = 73, "bhattacharya2007" = 352, "chakraborty2008" = 6, "koirala2003"=116,"pandey2016"=600,"pandey2017"=100, "rijal2003"=102, "rijal2010a"=32, "rijal2010b"=178,"sundar2007a"=250,"sundar2008"=225, "sundar2008b"=45, "sundar2009"=307, "sundar2010"=412, "sundar2011"=128,"sundar2012"=571,"sundar2014"=144,"sundar2015"=30,"sundar2019"=928)

Study designs are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:isc_study} as described in the publication or protocol. Four studies (428 [9.3\%] patients) were described as Phase 2 trials\cite{sundar2008,sundar2008B,sundar2011,sundar2015}, four studies (1,113 [24.2\%] patients) as Phase 3 trials\cite{sundar2007a,sundar2009,sundar2010,sundar2014}, two studies (468 [10.2\%] patients) as Phase 4 trials\cite{koirala2003,bhattacharya2007}, and one study (32 [0.7\%] patients) as a Phase 2/3 trial\cite{rijal2010a}.

Ten studies (1,625 [35.3\%] patients) allocated patients to more than one treatment arm\cite{das2009, sundar2007a,sundar2008, sundar2009, sundar2010, sundar2014, sundar2015, sundar2008B, chakraborty2008, rijal2010b}, of which six studies (1,411 [30.7\%] patients) were randomised\cite{das2009,sundar2007a,sundar2009,sundar2010,sundar2014} or partially randomised\cite{sundar2008}.

Treatment arms are summarised by study in Figure~\ref{fig:isc_treat}. The three largest studies were all monotherapy trials that treated with either 10~mg/kg single dose liposomal amphotericin B (1 study, 928 [20.2\%] patients)\cite{sundar2019}, or 28-day miltefosine (2 studies, 1,171 [25.5\%] patients).

Figure~\ref{fig:isc_treat} presents the different treatment regimens across all studies.

\subsubsection{Study Eligibility Criteria}

All studies recruited both male and female patients, and all but three studies restricted inclusion by age. Four studies only recruited patients aged 12 years and above (314 [6.8\%] patients)\cite{sundar2015,sundar2008B,sundar2008,rijal2010a}. Where specified, the \textit{lower} age limit was otherwise between 2 and 6 years. One study (100 [2.2\%] patients) recruited children only (< 15 years)\cite{pandey2017}. Otherwise, the \textit{upper} age limit ranged between 60 and 70 years.

In the 16 studies that included baseline haemoglobin level in their eligibility criteria, the median lower threshold was 50 g/L (range 35 to 60 g/L).\footnote{with one study reporting boosting haemoglobin with blood transfusions prior to recruitment\cite{das2009}.} Almost all studies excluded patients with serious illness or the presence of significant co-existing diseases. No study explicitly excluded patients based on malnutrition severity.

Twelve studies (2,021 [43.9\%] patients) explicitly reported performing HIV testing on all recruited patients\cite{koirala2003,bhattacharya2007,chakraborty2008,rijal2013,rijal2010a,sundar2007a,sundar2008,sundar2008B,sundar2009,sundar2010,sundar2014,sundar2015}, and patients with confirmed VL/HIV co-infection were excluded from all but two studies (280 [6.1\%] patients)\cite{rijal2003,rijal2010b}. Patients with HIV/VL co-infection from these two studies were excluded at the IPD level, where reported.

Inclusion criteria based on prior VL treatment were reported in 12 studies (2,629 [57.2\%] patients)\cite{sundar2019,sundar2015,sundar2014,sundar2011,sundar2010,sundar2009,sundar2008B,sundar2007a,rijal2010b,rijal2010a,rijal2003,das2009}, with timing since last VL treatment ranging from 10 days\cite{sundar2008B} to lifelong\cite{sundar2019}. One study (73 [1.6\%] patients) only recruited patients who had failed treatment with SSG\cite{das2009}.

Specific wording of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and exclusion thresholds for platelets, white blood cells, clotting, renal, and liver function, are provided in the \href{https://github.com/jpwil/dphil}{Supplementary Material}.

\subsubsection{Diagnostic Criteria}

The majority of studies specified clinical criteria for inclusion, with six studies (1,984 [43.1\%] patients) requiring $\geq$ 2 weeks' fever and splenomegaly\cite{sundar2019,sundar2014,rijal2010b,rijal2010a,rijal2003,pandey2016}. The remaining studies either did not specify the clinical criteria (two studies, 36 [0.8\%] patients)\cite{chakraborty2008,sundar2015}, or referred more generally to the presence of typical signs and symptoms (11 studies, 2,579 [56.1\%] patients).

VL was confirmed by tissue aspirate in all but two studies (1,528 [33.2\%] patients)\cite{pandey2016,sundar2019}, where the rK39 RDT was instead used as the primary diagnostic method. Three studies (276 [6.0\%] patients)\cite{pandey2017,rijal2010a,sundar2014}, screened patients with the rK39 RDT prior to confirmation with a tissue aspirate.

\subsubsection{Relapse}

Nine studies directly defined relapse in their publications or protocols\cite{sundar2019,koirala2003,sundar2007a,rijal2010a, rijal2010b,rijal2003,pandey2017,das2009,bhattacharya2007}. In the remaining studies, relapse events could be inferred indirectly from definitions of initial cure and treatment failure/success.  Confirmation with tissue aspirates was performed in 13 studies, and reported (at least partially) in the IPD in 12 studies (see \href{https://github.com/jpwil/dphil}{Supplementary Material} for study-specific details).

In the three studies that reported relapse beyond 6 months\cite{sundar2019,sundar2008,rijal2010b}, IPD interrogation allowed identification of the subset of patients where relapse occurred within 6 months of initial cure assessment. Active follow-up strategies were used to identify relapse events in all but one study (928 [20.2\%] patients)\cite{sundar2019}.

\subsubsection{Initial Cure}

Initial cure was assessed 28--30 days after treatment initiation in 14 studies (3,740 [81.3\%] patients)\cite{bhattacharya2007,chakraborty2008,das2009,pandey2016,pandey2017,rijal2003,rijal2010b,sundar2010,sundar2011,sundar2012,sundar2014,sundar2015,sundar2019,koirala2003}. In the remaining five studies, initial cure was assessed either at two different time points, depending on the treatment arm (two studies, 532 [11.6\%] patients)\cite{sundar2007a,sundar2009}, or between days 16 and 19 (three studies, 302 [6.6\%] patients)\cite{rijal2010a,sundar2008,sundar2008B}. Clinical criteria for initial cure were described in all but two studies\cite{bhattacharya2007,chakraborty2008}, although often loosely defined (see \href{https://github.com/jpwil/dphil}{Supplementary Material} for study-specific details).

Tissue aspirate formed part of the initial cure assessment in all but one study (928 [20.2\%] of patients without tissue aspirate)\cite{sundar2019}. In nine studies (1,378 [30.0\%] patients)\cite{bhattacharya2007,koirala2003,rijal2003,rijal2010a,sundar2007a,sundar2008B,sundar2009,sundar2014,sundar2015}, patients with an initial $1+$ parasite grade underwent a repeat aspirate 10 to 60 days later. If the repeat aspirate were negative, the patient would often be considered a `slow-responder', allowing progression to either definite cure or relapse.

\subsection{Patient Characteristics}

Overall (marginal) distributions of categorical and continuous variables are tabulated in Tables~\ref{tab:isc_categorical} and~\ref{tab:isc_continuous}, respectively. These distributions are also displayed graphically in Figure~\ref{fig:isc_cat_comb} for bar charts of categorical variables, and Figures~\ref{fig:isc_pooled_dist_cont_nolab} and~\ref{fig:isc_pooled_dist_cont_lab} for histograms of non-laboratory and laboratory variables, respectively. Study-specific distributions are presented for age, sex, and relapse in Figure~\ref{fig:isc_main_dist}. In the Appendix, study-specific distributions of all categorical and continuous variables are presented in Figures~\ref{fig:isc_comb_dist_cat} and~\ref{fig:isc_age_comb}--\ref{fig:isc_cr_log_comb}, respectively.

Patient numbers and proportions presented in this section exclude missing data. See Section \ref{sec:isc_missing_data} for further information on missing data.

\subsubsection{Categorical variables}

Across all studies, 2,745 (59.7\%) of patients were male, ranging from 50.0\% to 75.0\% at the study level.

Relapse within 6 months was identified in 228 (5.0\%) patients, varying from 0\% to 10.4\% at the study level.

The majority of patients (52.4\%) had mild/normal malnutrition according to the definition provided in Section \ref{sec:malnutrition}. Moderate and severe malnutrition affected 28.7\% and 18.9\% of patients overall, although these proportions varied significantly across studies and were affected by considerable missing data (see Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:isc_comb_dist_cat}).

Approximately half of all patients (2,051 [49.8\%] patients) had severe anaemia at the time of recruitment, as defined by the 2024 WHO guidelines\cite{who_haem2024}.

At the patient level, the most common treatment regimen was 28 days of oral miltefosine (1,639 [35.6\%] patients), followed by 10~mg/kg single dose liposomal amphotericin B (1,331 [28.9\%] patients). The remaining treatment regimens (1,629 [35.4\%] patients), consisted of a broad range of experimental and non-experimental regimens, including amphotericin B deoxycholate, other (non-Gilead) lipid formulations of amphotericin B, paromomycin, SSG, pentamidine, and human placenta extract (Figure~\ref{fig:isc_treat}).

The most common baseline parasite grade on tissue aspirate was $1+$ (1,201 [40.7\%] patients), while the median grade was $2+$ (764 [25.9\%] patients at this grade; IQR: 1 to 3). The proportion of patients decreased with increasing parasite grade, with 54 (1.8\%) patients with a parasite grade of $5+$. Where reported, 92.0\% (2,717 patients) of tissue aspirates were obtained from the spleen. The remaining aspirates were from bone marrow and accounted for almost all aspirates performed in three studies from Nepal\cite{rijal2010a,rijal2003,koirala2003} (Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:isc_comb_dist_cat}).

\subsubsection{Continuous variables}

The median age was 18 years, ranging from 1 to 80 years (IQR: 10 to 32 years). Overall the distribution was right-skewed, with study-specific distributions reflecting age-specific inclusion criteria. 138 (3.0\%) of patients were under 5 years, and 47 (1.0\%) were 65 years or over.

In adults ($\geq$ 19 years) the median BMI was 18.2~kg/m$^2$ (IQR: 16.4 to 20.8) (1,313 patients). In children ($\geq$ 5 and $<$ 19 years), the median BMI-for-age z-score was -1.68 (IQR: -2.67 to -0.72) (1,338 patients), and in younger children ($<$ 5 years) the median weight-for-height z-score was -1.80 (IQR: -2.97 to -0.99) (27 patients).

The median spleen size was 4 cm (IQR: 2 to 7 cm), and ranged from 0 to 22 cm. Eight studies reported patients without splenomegaly at baseline\cite{sundar2019, sundar2012, sundar2010, sundar2009,sundar2008,sundar2007a, pandey2017,bhattacharya2007}, corresponding to 218 (3.7\%) patients with recorded spleen sizes.

The median duration of fever prior to patient recruitment was 30 days (IQR: 20 to 60 days). The distribution was markedly right-skewed, ranging from 1 to 730 days.

\subsection{Univariable Associations}

Unadjusted relationships between variables (including all candidate predictors, excluding missing data) and relapse risk are presented in tabular form (Tables~\ref{tab:isc_categorical},~\ref{tab:isc_continuous}) and visually alongside their distributions (Figure~\ref{fig:isc_cat_comb} for categorical variables, and Figures~\ref{fig:isc_pooled_dist_cont_nolab} and~\ref{fig:isc_pooled_dist_cont_lab} for continuous non-laboratory and laboratory variables, respectively). The relationships are presented on the log-odds (logit) scale for continuous candidate predictors in Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:isc_logodds}.

Across continuous candidate predictors, GAM smooths suggested often non-linear relationships with relapse risk, with wider uncertainty at the extremes of the predictor distributions where data were sparse. Apparent trends were most evident for age, duration of fever and spleen size. Age showed a shallow U-shaped pattern, reaching a minimum relapse risk at approximately 20 years, while duration of fever showed a marked downward trend, with longer fever durations associated with lower relapse risk. With spleen size, a notable downward trend in risk was seen for spleen sizes over 2 cm, perhaps better appreciated on the logit scale in Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:isc_logodds}. For the laboratory predictors, weak upward trending monotonic patterns were observed for white blood cells and platelets, with higher values associated with increased relapse risk.

Trends in non-candidate predictors, including weight, height, and haemoglobin, were also apparent. A marked upward trend was seen with haemoglobin and relapse risk, which was also evidence in the categorical associations, with severe anaemia associated with a lower relapse risk compared to non-severe anaemia.

Treatment with miltefosine was associated with a higher unadjusted relapse risk when compared with 10~mg/kg single dose liposomal amphotericin B or `Other' treatment.

Patients with parasite grades of $3+$ and $4+$ were associated with higher relapse risk compared to patients with grades $1+$ and $2+$. Extrapolation of any trend to patients with $5+$ parasite grade was limited by small numbers.

A correlation matrix showing associations between continuous variables is presented in Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:isc_cont_cont}, and between continuous and categorical variables in Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:isc_cont_cat}. Inter-predictor correlations are considered further in the Discussion section.

\subsection{\label{sec:isc_missing_data}Missing Data}

Missing data were frequent among the candidate predictors, with 3,697 (80.4\%) of patients missing at least one candidate predictor data point. Just under half of all patients (2,177 [47.3\%] patients) were missing exactly one data point, and 1,520 (33.1\%) patients were missing two or more data points. No missing data were present in the outcome (relapse) or random-effect (study) variables.

The candidate predictor with the most missingness was malnutrition, which affected 1,921 (41.8\%) patients due to a lack of height information. After malnutrition, fever duration was missing in 1,779 (38.7\%) of patients, and parasite grade was missing in 1,647 (35.8\%) patients. Remaining predictors had under 15\% missingness. Missingness patterns, ordered by missingness in the candidate predictors, are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:isc_missing_summary} at the study level and overall.

\subsubsection{Multiple Imputation}

On review of the multiple imputation diagnostic plots (as described in Section \ref{sec:meth-missing} and available for review in the \href{https://github.com/jpwil/dphil}{Supplementary Material}), no clear or consistent patterns indicating violations of the missing-at-random assumption were apparent. Convergence was obtained well before the 20 iterations for the majority of imputed predictors, and the distributional assumptions of the imputation model appeared robust on inspection of the diagnostic density and scatter plots.

\section{Model Results}

Two models were fitted to the ISC IPD \textemdash\ one model including parasite grade as a candidate predictor, and one model excluding parasite grade.

\subsection{Model Specification and Coefficient Estimates}

Forest plots of the final model predictors are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:isc_var_forest_combined}. Full specification of the final models, including intercept terms, p-values, and predictor transformations, are presented in Appendix Tables~\ref{tab:isc_model_coeff_with_pg} and~\ref{tab:isc_model_coeff_without_pg}.

For both models, final predictors included: age (both linear and squared terms), duration of fever, treatment regimen, and presence of severe anaemia. Parasite grade was also included when considered as a candidate predictor. As can be appreciated from Figure~\ref{fig:isc_var_forest_combined}, the adjusted odds ratios were similar across the two models. The similarity between models can also be appreciated in Figure~\ref{fig:isc_adjusted_assoc}, which shows relapse probability predictions with the model intercept recalibrated to the Sundar 2019 dataset\cite{sundar2019}.

In both models, U-shaped relationships between age and relapse risk were shown, reflecting a significant positive age squared coefficient. Inverse relationships between fever duration and relapse risk were also demonstrated. In the model including parasite grade, the relapse odds decreased by 36.0\% (95\% CI\@: 23.1--46.7\%) for each doubling of fever duration, with similar findings with the model excluding parasite grade. When included, a unit increase in parasite grade (e.g.\ from $1+$ to $2+$) was associated with a 30.6\% increase in relapse odds (95\% CI\@: 12.1--52.2\%). Relapse odds in the 10~mg/kg single dose liposomal amphotericin B, or `Other' treatment groups were significantly lower (approximately half) than the odds in the standard dose miltefosine regimen, although with marked uncertainty. The presence of severe anaemia was also found to be associated with decreased odds of relapse by approximately one third (32.0\%, 95\% CI\@: 7.0--50.3\%) in the model including parasite grade. Appendix Tables~\ref{tab:isc_model_coeff_with_pg} and~\ref{tab:isc_model_coeff_without_pg} provide the complete predictor coefficients and standard errors for both models.

Pooled estimates of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC)\footnote{ICC quantifies the proportion of total variance in the latent propensity for the outcome attributable to between-study differences.} were 3.5\% for the model including parasite grade, and 4.4\% for the model excluding parasite grade.

\subsection{Model Performance and Internal Validation}

Apparent and optimism-adjusted c-statistics and calibration slopes are presented in Table~\ref{tab:isc_performance}. When assessed in studies with $>$5 relapse events, model discrimination was estimated at 0.70 (95\% CI\@: 0.66--0.74) in the model including parasite grade, and 0.69 (95\% CI\@: 0.64--0.74) in the model excluding parasite grade. These estimates reduced to 0.68 and 0.67, respectively, after adjusting for optimism. No evidence of significant between-study heterogeneity was identified in either model, with forest plots presented in Figure~\ref{fig:isc_forestCIM1} (model including parasite grade) and Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:isc_forestCIM2} (excluding parasite grade).

Optimism in calibration slopes were estimated at 0.093 and 0.098 in the models including and excluding parasite grade, respectively. Resulting uniform shrinkage factors were 0.91 and 0.92, respectively. Multiplying together these shrinkage factors with the estimated model coefficients will result in the optimism-adjusted coefficients (Appendix Tables \ref{tab:isc_model_coeff_with_pg} and \ref{tab:isc_model_coeff_without_pg}). No significant evidence of between-study heterogeneity in calibration slope was identified, with forest plots presented in Figure~\ref{fig:isc_forestCalM1} (model including parasite grade) and Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:isc_forestCalM2} (model excluding parasite grade).

Visual inspection of the calibration plots comparing predicted and observed relapse probabilities showed minimal deviation from perfect calibration (Figure~\ref{fig:isc_calPlot}). Calibration plots showing predicted and observed relapse probabilities for fever duration (Figure~\ref{fig:isc_calPlotFD1} for model including parasite grade), and other predictors (Appendix Figures~\ref{fig:isc_calPlotPD_ap} to \ref{fig:isc_calPlotRx1_ap} for model including parasite grade and~\ref{fig:isc_calPlotFD2_ap} to~\ref{fig:isc_calPlotRx2_ap} excluding parasite grade) and also showed good overall agreement, with predicted relapse probabilities lying within the 95\% confidence intervals of the observed probabilities.

Calibration intercepts (calibration-in-the-large) were found to vary significantly between studies for both models, as can be appreciated from the forest plots in Figure~\ref{fig:isc_forestCalM1} for the model including parasite grade, and Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:isc_forestCalM2} for the model excluding parasite grade (test for heterogeneity; p = 0.01 and p = 0.002 for models including and excluding parasite grade).

The distribution of the final predictors selected across the 2~$\times$~500 bootstrap models are presented in Appendix Table~\ref{tab:isc_model_stability}. Reassuringly, the most frequently selected predictors correspond to the final predictors selected in both final models. However, a degree of instability is apparent, with predictors such as spleen size, sex, alanine aminotransferase, and the cubic age term being selected in 100--250 bootstraps.

\section{Summary}

In summary, two prognostic models predicting relapse were fitted to the ISC IPD \textemdash\ one including parasite grade as a candidate predictor and one excluding it. Both final models retained the same core predictors: age (modelled using linear and squared terms, yielding a U-shaped association), duration of fever (inverse association), treatment regimen (lower relapse risk with LAMB and `Other' regimens compared with miltefosine), and severe anaemia (lower relapse risk with increased severity). When parasite grade was included, it was retained and associated with a higher risk of relapse.

Discriminative performance was modest. The pooled apparent c-statistics were 0.70 (95\% CI 0.66--0.74) for the model including parasite grade and 0.69 (95\% CI 0.64--0.74) for the model excluding it, reducing after optimism correction to 0.68 and 0.67, respectively. Overall agreement between observed and predicted relapse risk was good across predictors, although significant between-study variation in calibration intercepts (calibration-in-the-large) was observed for both models.

The following section presents an analogous summary of the East Africa models using the same structure, enabling direct comparison with the ISC model results.
