\section{Introduction}

This chapter provides important context for the development and validation of prognostic models predicting VL relapse in the Indian subcontinent (ISC) and East Africa. It begins with an overview of VL, outlining its epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, and management. Emphasis is placed on the epidemiology of VL and the ongoing WHO-supported elimination programmes in the ISC and East Africa, defining the public health landscape in which a VL prognostic model would be implemented.

The section on relapse is presented as a narrative synthesis informed by a systematic review of the literature (full methods in Appendix \ref{app:background}). Using pre-specified inclusion criteria, the review identifies and evaluates studies describing the burden, mechanisms, and determinants of relapse. The discussion highlights how relapse constitutes a high-risk infection reservoir that, together with PKDL and HIV/VL co-infection, poses a major threat to elimination efforts---a threat that could be mitigated through early identification of patients at high risk of relapse, enabling timely diagnosis and treatment.

\section{Visceral leishmaniasis}
% speak more broadly about leishmaniases before narrowing in on VL specifically
The leishmaniases are a diverse group of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) caused by protozoan parasites of the \textit{Leishmania} genus and transmitted between susceptible mammalian hosts via the bite of infected female sandflies. At least 20 \textit{Leishmania} species infect humans, causing four principal disease forms: cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL), visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) (see Box \ref{box:main-four})\cite{farrar2023manson, burza2018,who_leish}. Disease form is largely determined by parasite species and strain, resulting in a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging in severity from the relatively common and usually self-healing skin lesions seen in CL, to the often disfiguring mucosal destruction of MCL, and life-threatening systemic illness of VL. PKDL is a disseminated dermal eruption that may occur following VL recovery, and while patients are systemically well, they have been shown to remain infective to sandflies\cite{burza2018}.

VL represents the most severe manifestation of leishmaniasis, accounting for the vast majority of its morbidity and mortality. The disease overwhelmingly affects impoverished rural populations with poor access to healthcare. VL is also recognised as an opportunistic infection in patients living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), in whom co-infection leads to particularly high rates of treatment failure and death.

\begin{mybox}{Principal disease forms of Leishmaniasis\cite{who_leish,farrar2023manson}}
    \begin{description}
        \item[Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL)] Results in lesions on exposed skin that can lead to ulceration and life-long scarring. Often self-healing within a year, but can manifest atypical and disseminated forms, especially in the immunocompromised. Up to 1 million new cases per year with most cases occurring in the Americas, Mediterranean basin, Middle East and Central Asia.
        \item[Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL)] Rare complication of CL seen especially in the Americas with most cases reported in Bolivia, Peru and Brazil. Results in destructive ulceration of the oral and nasal mucosa. Highly stigmatising and challenging to treat.
        \item[Visceral leishmaniasis (VL)] Also known as kala-azar, the most severe form of leishmaniasis caused by \textit{L. donovani} in the Old World and \textit{L. infantum} in the New World. With an estimated 50,000--90,000 cases/year, VL presents with progressive weight loss, splenomegaly and fever. Considered fatal without treatment.
        \item[Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL)] Benign macular and/or papular rash often including the face, arms, and trunk.  Affects 5--20\% of patients months to years after successful initial treatment for VL in the Indian subcontinent and East Africa. Often self-limiting, although known to be infective to sandflies and therefore acts as a disease reservoir.

\subsection{Epidemiology}

% where, how much, how transmitted, who’s at risk 
This section provides an overview of the current global distribution, transmission dynamics, and risk factors for developing visceral leishmaniasis, highlighting major regional differences in disease burden and risk.

VL is endemic\footnote{Defined by the WHO as the occurrence of at least one autochthonous case with demonstrated local transmission within a country\cite{who_wer2023}.} in at least 80 countries across tropical, semi-tropical and temperate climes. The disease is caused by two closely related \textit{Leishmania} species whose distribution defines the four principal global regions of high endemicity (see figure \ref{fig:gho_map}): \textit{L. donovani}, responsible for anthroponotic transmission (human$\rightarrow$sandfly$\rightarrow$ human) in the ISC and East Africa, and \textit{L. infantum}\footnote{Previously referred to as \textit{L. chagasi} in the Americas.}, responsible for zoonotic transmission (mammal$\rightarrow$sandfly$\rightarrow$human) in the Americas (principally Brazil) and Mediterranean basin, extending into the Middle East and Central Asia\cite{who_wer2023,who_gho}. Together, these two species comprise the \textit{L. donovani complex}.

\subsubsection{Disease burden}

Estimating the global burden of VL is problematic. True case numbers are obscured by significant underreporting due to limited access to healthcare, inadequate diagnostic facilities, misdiagnosis, and poor surveillance systems in many endemic countries\cite{chappuis2007,singh2006, mubayi2010, maia-elkhoury2007}. In 2012, Alvar et al published the results of a WHO-led update to the global incidence of leishmaniasis using country-level reporting from the mid-late 2000s\cite{alvar2012}. Underreporting rates were estimated through consultation with country representatives and disease experts. The global incidence was estimated at 200,000--400,000 cases/year, with approximately 80\% of the burden originating from the ISC and 15\% from East Africa. Compared to official reporting over the same period, this reflected a global underreporting rate of 3.5--7-fold.

Since the publication of Alvar et al's estimates, the number of cases has undisputedly fallen, driven largely by decreases in the ISC following the launch of the Kala-Azar Elimination Programme (KAEP) in 2005. Reported cases decreased from >50,000 cases/year prior to 2012, to approximately 22,500 cases/year in 2017 and <12,000 cases/year in 2023\cite{who_gho} (high hicidence country breakdowns presented in Figure \ref{fig:gho_plot_top8}). Notably, this downward trend has persisted despite improvements in surveillance and reporting systems in many endemic countries\cite{who_wer2023}. Reflecting these changes, the WHO revised its estimated annual incidence in 2017 to 50,000--90,000 cases/year\footnote{According to the online WHO Leishmaniasis Fact Sheet: \url{https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis}. Alternate WHO online content estimates 30,000 cases/year since 2020: \url{https://www.who.int/health-topics/leishmaniasis} (online material last accessed October 2025).}\cite{WHO_2016_leishmaniasis,who_leish}.

    \caption{Temporal trends of visceral leishmaniasis incidence by country. Comparison between the top 8 countries with the highest average case numbers reported between 2013 and 2023. Data sourced from the World Health Organization Global Health Observatory\cite{who_gho}.}
    \label{fig:gho_plot_top8}
\end{figure}

Based on the most recent reporting data from 2023\cite{who_gho}, the five countries with the highest case numbers are now, in descending order, Sudan, Ethiopia, Brazil, Kenya and South Sudan---collectively comprising 72.4\% of the global total. In stark contrast to the situation 20 years ago, countries in the ISC now account for only 6.3\% of the reported total: India with 538 cases (4.6\%), Nepal with 168 cases (1.4\%), and Bangladesh with just 34 cases (0.3\%).

\subsubsection{Mortality}

The disease is widely described as `fatal without treatment'\cite{burza2018,farrar2023manson}. Supporting this statement are the high mortality figures recorded during conflict-related epidemics in East Africa over the last 40 years, and prior to effective therapy, 19\textsuperscript{th} century accounts of outbreaks devastating communities across the Gangetic plains\cite{collin2004, gibson1983,steverding2017}. Despite this, subclinical disease forms have been reported with spontaneous resolution\cite{mouri2015,badaro1986}.

With treatment, \textasciitilde5--15\% of cases result in death, although accurate estimates are challenged by a lack of reporting. Where deaths are reported, they frequently only reflect hospital deaths and omit those where a definite diagnosis was missed. In the 2000s, it was often cited that VL was responsible for up to 50,000 deaths/year---the second highest mortality from a parasitic disease after malaria\cite{chappuis2007}---although more recent estimates tentatively place the figure at a more modest 4,627 deaths/year with a wide uncertainty range of 1,853--8,725 deaths/year\cite{gbd2023}.

\subsubsection{Vector}
Measuring 2--4 mm and covered in dense hairs, phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae) appear distinctly fuzzy under magnification. Females from an estimated 31 species across two genera are known to transmit the parasite between human hosts: \textit{Lutzomyia} in the New World and \textit{Phlebotomine} in the Old World\cite{akhoundi2016}. Sandflies occupy a wide range of ecological niches, found on every continent except Antarctica. Biting occurs from dusk to dawn, with females requiring a blood meal for larval development. During the day they are found in cool and sheltered locations, such as in cracks and crevices in walls as seen with \textit{Ph. argentipes}, responsible for transmission in the ISC. In East Africa, three sandfly vectors have been implicated in \textit{L. donovani} transmission, defining two distinct and non-overlapping ecological settings: (i) the \textit{Acacia-Balanites} and black cotton soil savannah regions in northern focus of northern Ethiopia, Sudan and northern South Sudan, where \textit{Ph. orientalis} thrives, and (ii) the savannah and forested areas in the southern focus of southern Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda, where \textit{Ph. martini} and \textit{Ph. celiae} are seen in association with \textit{Macrotermes} termite mounds.

In addition to sandflies, needle sharing among people who inject drugs was considered an important route of transmission in the southern Mediterranean region during the 1990s and 2000s, particularly among people living with HIV \cite{alvar1997}. Exceptionally, transmission can result from blood transfusion, organ transplantation, congenital infection, laboratory accidents\cite{farrar2023manson}, and possibly even sexual contact\cite{guedes2020, symmers1960}.

\subsubsection{Reservoirs}

Similar to the majority of \textit{Leishmania} spp. causing CL and MCL, \textit{L. infantum} demonstrates zoonotic transmission, with domestic dogs being the main reservoir host in both the Americas and the Old World. This being said, an ever-increasing list of wild and domestic animals are known to harbour the parasite, including cats, foxes, horses, rodents, bats and opossums, although their relevance to human infection is unclear\cite{alcover2020, ratzlaff2023}. An outbreak near Madrid (2009--2012) was attributed to hares\cite{molina2012}.

In contrast to \textit{L. infantum}, and importantly from an elimination perspective, \textit{L. donovani} transmission in the ISC and East Africa is predominantly anthroponotic. Although \textit{L. donovani} infections have been reported in several animal species in both regions including cattle, dogs and rats, the significance of these infections as  sources of human transmission has yet to be established\cite{kushwaha2024, jones2021}.

\subsubsection{Risk factors}

From population prevalence studies we know that only a minority of people with detectable parasites develop symptoms\cite{pederiva2022, burza2018}. Risk factors for acquiring an initial asymptomatic infection and subsequent progression to symptomatic disease reflect a tangled ecology of determinants linking host factors (sandfly exposure, immunity, genetics) and parasite factors (strain, virulence, inoculum). A common theme, woven into many of these determinants, is poverty.

In both the ISC and East Africa the median age of infection during stable transmission is similar at 15--20 years. More men than women are infected and develop disease, likely reflecting their increased occupational exposure to sandflies (for example, cattle herding and other outdoor activities)\cite{who_wer2023}.

In the ISC\footnote{Despite sporadic VL cases reported from Pakistan, Bhutan and Sri Lanka, in this thesis ISC refers to India, Nepal and Bangladesh.}, VL endemicity is centred on the fertile and low-lying alluvial plains of the Ganges river, where high humidity, heavy monsoon rains, and abundant vegetation provide ideal conditions for sustained transmission between sandflies and humans\cite{bhunia2010}. Significant clustering of cases is seen across the rural farming communities of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal in northeastern India, central and western Bangladesh, and southeastern Nepal. In a systematic review by Bern et al, determinants of VL transmission in the ISC included living in mud houses, proximity to prior cases (in the same or nearby household), presence of vegetation and standing water surrounding the house, sleeping on the floor or outside, malnutrition, and a lack of bed net use\cite{bern2010}.

The greatest concentration of cases in East Africa is reported in the northern focus, specifically between the eastern Sudanese state of Gederaf and the bordering northern states of Ethiopia. Many of the epidemiological determinants of VL in East Africa are shared with the ISC, with poverty remaining the central overarching factor. Notable determinants include living in rural settings near sandfly breeding and resting sites (living near termite mounds in the southern focus, sleeping under \textit{Acacia} trees in the northern focus), living in proximity to other VL infected (or recently infected) people, and malnutrition\cite{geto2024}.

HIV co-infection has reshaped VL epidemiology in many endemic regions, and remains the most important risk factor for asymptomatic infection, disease progression, and poor treatment outcomes. In the mid-1980s in Spain and other southern European countries, VL shifted from a rare childhood disease to one predominantly affecting HIV-positive adults\cite{monge2014,alvar2008}. HIV co-infection rates are currently increasing in Brazil (now reported in 20\% of new cases\cite{PAHO_Leishmaniasis_2024}) and India (>10\% of VL episodes in 2023 and 2024\cite{NCVBDC2025}). In northern Ethiopia, HIV co-infection presents a significant challenge to elimination, affecting between 20 and 50\% of cases predominantly in male migrant workers\cite{diro2014}.

% host immunity is key some of this thesis' conclusions, and explaining relapse predictors
Host immunity—--particularly cell-mediated immunity—--is a major determinant of disease onset and treatment outcomes, and thought to be a key driver of several devastating epidemics associated with war and natural disasters. A striking example is Sudan in the 1980s-2000s, where population displacement driven by conflict and famine brought immune-naïve populations into endemic areas, and spread infection into previously unaffected areas. Combined with severe malnutrition and the collapse of health infrastructure, the resulting mortality was catastrophic\cite{zijlstra1991, collin2004, al-salem2016}.

The geographic and demographic heterogeneity of VL reflects fundamental differences in host-parasite interactions and immune responses. To understand how these epidemiological patterns arise and why certain groups experience more severe disease, it is necessary to examine the pathophysiology of human \textit{Leishmania} infection.

\subsection{Pathophysiology}
% I'm including this chapter before clinical/diagnostic details because it provides important background  

Parasites of the genus \textit{Leishmania} belong to the family \textit{Trypanosomatidae} (class \textit{Kinetoplastea}, phylum \textit{Euglenozoa}) and share many features with two other human pathogens of the same family; \textit{Trypanosoma brucei}---the causative agent of African sleeping sickness (human African Trypanosomiasis), and \textit{Trypanosoma~cruzi}---the agent of Chagas disease in the Americas. These vector-borne NTDs are all single-celled protozoa characterized by a flagellum and a kinetoplast---a dense network of mitochondrial DNA giving them a distinctive microscopic appearance.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/ch2/cdc_lifecycle.png} % path to your figure file
    \caption{Life cycle of the \textit{Leishmania} parasite consists of a vector (sandfly) stage and reservoir (animal) stage.

    \label{fig:cdc_lifecycle}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Life cycle}
In the sandfly gut, \textit{Leishmania} parasites exist in their extracellular flagellated promastigote form. During a blood meal, these are regurgitated into the bite wound and rapidly phagocytosed by macrophages. Intracellularly, in the human host, the protozoa lose their flagellum and transform into amastigotes: oval bodies measuring \textasciitilde2--6$\mu$m in length with their characteristic nucleus and kinetoplast clearly visible on nucleic acid staining. Intracellular amastigotes multiply through binary fission, eventually leading to cell lysis and subsequent uptake by neighboring macrophages to perpetuate infection. In viscerotropic disease caused by \textit{L. donovani complex}, this cycle drives widespread dissemination with macrophage proliferation and granuloma formation across the mononuclear phagocyte system, including in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. The cycle continues when sandflies ingest infected macrophages during a subsequent blood meal, initiating parasite development within the vector (figure \ref{fig:cdc_lifecycle}).

\subsubsection{Immune evasion}

Remarkably, intracellular amastigotes have evolved to survive and replicate within the hostile phagolysosomal environment of the macrophage. Although the full immunological mechanisms remain incompletely understood and beyond the scope of this chapter, key strategies include the presence of a lipophosphoglycan surface coat that protects promastigotes from complement-mediated lysis, and suppression of macrophage activation by inducing functional impairment of cytotoxic T-cell responses. Despite the presence of a pronounced humoral response, with a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia typically seen, the resulting antibodies are predominantly non-neutralising and may even play a role in maintaining the immunosuppressive milieu required for amastigote survival\cite{stager2010,kaye2020}. As the disease progresses, so too does the host's immunosuppressive state, driven by rising levels of immunoregulatory cytokines (especially IL-10 and TGF$\beta$) and the destructive remodelling of lymphoid architecture\cite{kaye2020,nylen2010}.

\subsection{Clinical features}

% could include a lot more information here, for example, WHO case classification, elaboration on frequency of symptoms
The clinical spectrum of \textit{Leishmania} infection is remarkably broad, with asymptomatic carriers outnumbering symptomatic cases by a factor of 5--200 in endemic settings\cite{pederiva2022,burza2018,werneck2002}. When symptomatic, disease onset is typically insidious, following an incubation period ranging from several weeks, to months, and occasionally years.

Classic symptoms result from a persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome with infiltration of the mononuclear phagocyte system, resulting in intermittent fever, weight loss, splenomegaly, often with accompanying hepatomegaly and, in parts of East Africa, lymphadenopathy.  The spleen is usually non-tender on palpation, but massive splenomegaly $\pm$ hepatomegaly can result in severe abdominal pain. The grayish skin hyperpigmentation (`kala-azar'---literally `black disease' or `black fever' in Hindi), described in historical accounts of chronic disease in the ISC before effective therapy became available, is now uncommon\cite{chappuis2007, farrar2023manson}.

Characteristic laboratory abnormalities include raised inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), pancytopenia, a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia, and hypoalbuminaemia. Anaemia is often severe, normocytic, and normochromic, and likely multifactorial in origin, with splenic sequestration and anaemia of chronic disease thought to play important roles\cite{varma2010,goto2017}. Haemoglobin levels at presentation are frequently between 6--10 g/dL\cite{varma2010}, resulting in pallor and contributing to weakness.

Without treatment, disease severity correlates with increasing parasite burden\cite{zacarias2017,silva2014}. Patients may develop vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, and dyspnoea, reflecting a combination of direct mucosal invasion, and opportunistic infections arising from the host's immunosuppressed state. The presence of oedema, jaundice, severe co-infection, and bleeding with disseminated intravascular coagulation indicates a poor prognosis\cite{costa2023}.

\subsection{Diagnosis}

% could include WHO case definition - omitted given length concerns
The gold standard for diagnosing VL combines compatible clinical features with direct visualisation of \textit{Leishmania} amastigotes in tissue aspirates obtained from the spleen, bone marrow, or lymph node. Splenic aspiration offers the highest sensitivity (93--99\%) but carries a small risk of fatal haemorrhage. Bone marrow and lymph node aspirates are safer but considered less sensitive (\textasciitilde50--80\%)\cite{farrar2023manson,burza2018}. Parasite density is usually expressed using a logarithmic semiquantitative grading system (0--6+) originally described by Chulay and Bryceson (Table \ref{tab:grading})\cite{chulay1983}.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Logarithmic grading system for parasite load on microscopy of tissue aspirates described by Chulay and Bryceson\cite{chulay1983}. Smears are stained with Giemsa and examined using a $10\times$ eyepiece and $100\times$ objective lens.}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Grade} & \textbf{Average parasite density} \\
        \midrule
        $0$            & 0 amastigotes/1,000 fields        \\
        $1+$           & 1--10 amastigotes/1,000 fields    \\
        $2+$           & 1--10 amastigotes/100 fields      \\
        $3+$           & 1--10 amastigotes/10 fields       \\
        $4+$           & 1--10 amastigotes/field           \\
        $5+$           & 10--100 amastigotes/field         \\
        $6+$           & >100 amastigotes/field            \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:grading}
\end{table}

Culture of tissue aspirates can improve diagnostic sensitivity but is limited by cost, technical complexity, and a slow turnaround of up to four weeks. Molecular assays have been developed but remain infrequently available outside research settings and regions of high endemicity. Notably, peripheral blood quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays amplifying kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) have shown high sensitivities in patients with both VL and HIV co-infection\cite{galluzzi2018, rihs2025, verrest2024}, obviating the need for invasive sampling where available. Urine antigen detection has demonstrated specificity but suffers from low diagnostic sensitivity\cite{vangriensven2018, riera2004}.

A wide gamut of serological (antibody-detecting) tests is available for the diagnosis of VL, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assays, immunoblots, and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)\cite{farrar2023manson}. The rK39 immunochromatographic test (ICT) is the most widely used RDT, providing a binary result within 10--20 minutes from a finger-prick blood sample. In the ISC, rK39 RDTs demonstrate excellent sensitivity (97.0\%, 95\% CI: 90.0--99.5\%)\cite{boelaert2014} and have served as the first-line diagnostic test since the mid-2000s. In East Africa, however, sensitivity is lower (85.3\%, 95\% CI: 74.5--93.2\%), and a second serological test---the direct agglutination test (DAT)---is recommended to confirm negative rK39 results\cite{boelaert2014}. Key limitations of serological tests include their inability to distinguish between active and past infection, with antibodies persisting for months to years following successful treatment and their reduced sensitivity in patients with severe immunosuppression, particularly those with HIV co-infection\cite{burza2018}.

\subsection{Treatment}

Injectable pentavalent antimonials have been the workhorse of VL treatment since the 1940s\footnote{Previously, since the 1910s, tartar emetic was used---a toxic \textit{trivalent} antimonial compound also used as an emetic.}, and despite their relatively toxic adverse effects (pancreatitis, cardiac arrhythmias, hepatitis), they remain first-line therapy in both East Africa [sodium stibogluconate (SSG), as part of combination therapy] and in Brazil [as meglumine antimoniate (MA)]\cite{WHO_TRS_949_2010,Brasil_2024_GuiaVigilanciaSaude}. From the early 1980s in Bihar, India, treatment failure rates exceeding 50\% were observed with SSG despite dose escalation (10$\rightarrow$20 mg/kg/day) and duration (6$\rightarrow$40 days). Blame was attributed to poor stewardship, with subtherapeutic dosing practices driving resistance\cite{sundar2001}. As efficacy declined, second-line agents were used---initially pentamidine (limited by severe toxicity), and later amphotericin B deoxycholate (ABD), effective but constrained by infusion reactions, nephrotoxicity, and the need for prolonged hospitalisation.

Over the past two decades, the introduction of three new agents---miltefosine, liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome\textsuperscript{\textregistered}; Gilead Sciences), and paromomycin---has transformed the previously limited and often toxic treatment arsenal\cite{alves2018}.

Miltefosine (MF), a repurposed anticancer drug, is the only effective oral agent for VL. Introduced as the first-line treatment in the ISC in 2005, MF played a pivotal role in the early KAEP\cite{sundar2002,bhattacharya2007,who_sea_elim2005}. Its use has since declined. Concerns about teratogenicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and decreasing efficacy\cite{rijal2013,sundar2012} led to its replacement in the KAEP by single-dose liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB) (AmBisome\textsuperscript{\textregistered}; Gilead Sciences) in 2014--15\cite{chatterjee2025}. Outside the ISC, MF performs poorly as monotherapy in East Africa and Brazil\cite{alves2018, carnielli2019}.
% Eye side effects\cite{WHO2023MiltefosineAdvisory} - omit for now

Supported by a WHO--Gilead donation programme, a single intravenous (IV) dose of 10mg/kg LAMB remains the first-line regimen in the ISC owing to its efficacy and safety\cite{WHO2023GileadAgreement}. At higher cumulative doses of 21--30mg/kg given over 5--10 days, LAMB is also used as first-line therapy in Europe and as a second-line option in Brazil and East Africa, particularly in patients intolerant of pentavalent antimonials (severe disease, extremes of age, pregnancy, renal or hepatic dysfunction, relapse, HIV co-infection).

Paromomycin (PM), an injectable aminoglycoside, is effective both as monotherapy and in combination regimens in the ISC\cite{sundar2007a}. Despite its low cost and favourable safety profile, uptake in the ISC has been limited. In East Africa, by contrast, SSG--PM combination therapy has been first-line since 2010\cite{WHO_TRS_949_2010,musa2012}, with evidence also supporting its use alongside MF in both East Africa and the ISC\cite{musa2023,sundar2011comb}.

\subsection{Elimination efforts}

% Where transmission is anthroponotic, xenodiagnosis studies confirm that the most important infectious reservoir are patients with active VL and PKDL\cite{singh2021, mondal2019}. 
% Concerns re: CL as potential reservoir \cite{bhattarai2025}

In areas of anthroponotic transmission, control of VL centres on two interdependent strategies: (i) reduction of the human infection reservoir through early diagnosis and treatment, and (ii) interruption of transmission events through vector control measures. Effective implementation of these approaches requires evidence-based decision-making and sustained political will.

% ISC elimination
Guided by these principles, in 2005 the governments of Nepal, Bangladesh, and India, with WHO support, signed a Memorandum of Understanding to reduce VL incidence to fewer than 1 case per 10,000 population at the district or sub-district level by 2015. This deadline was later extended and is now embedded within the 2021--2030 WHO NTD roadmap\cite{who_sea_elim2005, WHO_KalaAzarElimination_2015, WHO_SEA_CD_329_2021, WHO_NTDs_Roadmap_2021_2030, WHO_Global_Report_NTDs_2025}. The initial success of the KAEP was attributed to the introduction of highly sensitive rK39 RDTs, oral MF, and subsequently single dose LAMB, alongside active case detection and vector control measures such as indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide treated nets (ITN)\cite{sundar2018}. In October 2023, Bangladesh became the first country to eliminate VL as a public health problem\cite{nagi2024}. Nepal and India are currently working to sustain their targets for 3 consecutive years to achieve elimination status\cite{pandey2025}.

As the ISC enters the consolidation and maintenance phases of the KAEP, concerns regarding sustainability are increasingly voiced\cite{chatterjee2025}. Waning political momentum and financial support threaten the viability of costly IRS and active case detection. Moreover, as the proportion of immunologically naïve individuals increases, so too does the risk of future outbreaks\cite{lerutte2017}.

% EA elimination
Buoyed by the KAEP experience, calls for VL elimination in East Africa\cite{alvar2021} culminated in the 2023 \textit{Nairobi Declaration}, endorsed by the health ministries of nine endemic East African countries\footnote{Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda} and aiming to reduce VL incidence by 90\% by 2030. Similar to the KAEP, a phased approach has been proposed---consisting of planning, attack, consolidation, and maintenance phases---with emphasis placed on equitable access to diagnosis and treatment, integrated vector management adapted to diverse ecological settings, and strong cross-border collaboration\cite{WHO_nairobi_declaration, WHO_2024_VL_easternAfrica}.

However, in contrast to the KAEP, the East Africa initiative faces greater operational complexity. Challenges include heterogeneous transmission ecologies, weaker health systems, reliance on multi-dose treatments, and limited access to sensitive diagnostic tools\cite{WHO_2024_VL_easternAfrica}.

Early diagnosis and treatment of all human infection reservoirs remain a cornerstone of any successful anthroponotic elimination strategy, underpinning efforts to interrupt onward transmission. The next section examines the burden, mechanisms, and determinants of VL relapse---a reservoir of particular concern and of critical relevance to elimination strategies.

\section(Relapse)

The contents of this section are guided by a systematic review of the literature and structured as a narrative review (see box \ref{box:lit-search1}). Search terms were constructed to identify the burden, timing, mechanisms, and determinants of VL relapse, with a focus on immunocompetent patients in the ISC and East Africa. Further details are available in Appendix \ref{app:background}.

VL relapse is defined as the reappearance of signs and symptoms of VL following an initial treatment response\cite{WHO2010kalaazarIndicators, WHO2024_Leishmaniasis}. In both research settings and routine clinical practice, relapse is usually confirmed through direct visualisation of the parasite from a tissue aspirate smear\cite{chhajed2024}.

Importantly, a patient may only relapse once an initial treatment response is achieved---termed \textit{initial cure} in clinical efficacy studies. In research settings, initial cure requires not only improvement of the patient's signs and symptoms (e.g., defervescence, reduction in spleen size, weight gain, improvement of haemoglobin), but also confirmation of parasite clearance with microscopy. The confirmation of initial cure if referred to as `test of cure', and often occurs within a month of treatment completion, although considerable heterogeneity exists in precisely how and when treatment outcomes are assessed\cite{dahal2024}.

\subsection{Burden of relapse}

% general comment---high relapse rates in certain populations
The proportion of immunocompetent patients that relapse following an initial treatment response varies considerably across studies, reflecting differences in host, treatment, and parasite factors\cite{chhajed2024}. As a `rule of thumb', relapse rates with current first-line regimens in patients \textit{without} significant immunosuppression range between 1 in 40 to 1 in 10 patients (2.5--10\%)\cite{chhajed2024}. In a meta-analysis of efficacy studies by Chhajed et al, the overall proportion of HIV-negative patients relapsing in the ISC within 6 months of treatment was estimated at 3.5\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.8--4.5\%) following first-line treatment with single-dose LAMB\cite{chhajed2024}. Under pragmatic conditions in East Africa, slightly higher 6-month relapse rates of approximately 5\% are seen with the first-line combination therapy of PM and SSG\cite{kimutai2017,atia2015,melaku2007}.

These estimates, however, likely understate the true relapse burden for two principal reasons: (i) relapses occurring beyond 6-months of follow-up are missed, and (ii) clinical trial populations do not reflect the broader patient population seen in routine care. Chhajed et al also showed that, across 21 studies that reported both 6 and 12 month relapse rates, one third of all relapses by 12 months occurred during the second half of the 12 months period\cite{chhajed2024}. Similarly, several large studies from the ISC have shown comparable or even higher relapses counts occurring between 6--12 months than in the initial 6 month period, prompting calls to extend routine follow-up from 6 to 12 months\cite{sundar2019,rijal2013,burza2013,burza2014,goyal2019}. Furthermore, trials often exclude patients at increased risk of relapse, such as those at the extremes of age, with more severe disease and comorbidities. Trial patients are also managed under controlled conditions that incentivise adherence. These factors collectively bias relapse estimates downward compared with outcomes observed under routine programmatic conditions.

% Recovery of a host's cell-mediated immunity can be demonstrated by the conversion of a Leishmanin skin test (LST) from negative to positive\footnote{Also known as the Montenegro test, initially developed in the 1920s to support the diagnosis of CL. Analogous to the Mantoux test for latent tuberculosis, a delayed-type hypersensitivity response from the LST manifests as visible skin induration occurring 48--72 hours after an intradermal injection of \textit{Leishmania} antigen\cite{carstens-kass2021}.}. During active infection, the LST is expected to be negative due to cellular anergy. Subsequent conversion to a positive test following treatment strongly indicates successful immune reconstitution, and conferring lasting protection from relapse and reinfection.

\subsection{Relapse vs. reinfection}

Distinguishing relapse due to parasite recrudescence from re-infection due to a new strain is important when assessing drug efficacy and evaluating relapse determinants. However, unlike in malaria\cite{WHO_2009_surveillance_antimalarial_drug_efficacy}, in VL there are no validated molecular targets for PCR confirmation. Despite this, growing evidence now supports that the majority of observed relapses do indeed occur due to recrudescence. For example, Rijal et al performed kDNA fingerprinting in 8 pairs of bone marrow samples in HIV-negative patients prior to primary infection treatment and at the time of relapse. No evidence of reinfection was found, with 8 distinct kDNA fingerprints identified across the 16 samples that matched at the individual patient level\cite{rijal2013}. Similar studies have been performed in HIV co-infection patients in East Africa and Europe employing a variety of molecular techniques, and showing that while reinfection does occur, it is considerably less common than recrudescence\cite{franssen2021, morales2002, gelanew2010,lachaud2009}.

\subsection{Relapse determinants}

When selecting candidate predictors for inclusion in a prognostic model, it is important to be guided by a knowledge of previously described predictors\cite{collins2024A}. Therefore, to provide important context for the upcoming chapters on relapse model development, this section presents a summary of the relapse predictors identified through the aforementioned literature review.

For immunocompetent patients, the literature review is intended to be exhaustive. Studies are excluded that (i) do not adopt a longitudinal design, where index VL cases are matched with subsequent relapse episodes occurring in the same patients, (ii) contain over 5\% HIV co-infection and without disaggregating relapse predictors by HIV status, and (iii) explore only treatment regimens and/or biomarkers (including molecular targets or cytokine not routinely performed in clinical practice). Whilst not intended to be exhaustive, important studies performed in patients with HIV co-infection, or reviewing biomarkers and treatments predictive of relapse are also discussed.

Four systematic reviews were identified describing predictors of relapse in both patients with and without HIV co-infection\cite{hirve2016, santos2023}, or in patients with HIV co-infection alone\cite{cota2011,alemayehu2016}. Where appropriate, references from these reviews inform the narrative review.

It is important to recognise that whether or not a study identifies a significant association between a predictor and relapse does not necessarily correspond to whether or not the predictor is important. For example, (i) not all predictors are considered by all studies, (ii) many studies have small sample sizes and are therefore underpowered to detect certain associations, and (iii) a wide range of study designs, statistical tests, predictor transformations, and modelling strategies are employed, affecting what is considered `significant'. Furthermore, the significance of an association will also depend on the other variables adjusted for in the prediction model.

\subsubsection{Immunocompetent patients}

%Systematic reviews
%A word about study heterogeneity

A total of 11 studies were identified reporting relapse determinants in immunocompetent patients, after excluding studies that were not longitudinal and those solely reporting treatment and/or biomarker associations. As presented in Table \ref{tab:relapse-rf}, eight studies were from the ISC, including India\cite{burza2014, goyal2019, goyal2020,ostyn2014, sundar2019}, Bangladesh\cite{lucero2015, mondal2019}, and Nepal\cite{rijal2013}, two studies from East Africa, including South Sudan\cite{gorski2010} and Kenya\cite{kennedy2024}, and one study from Georgia\cite{kajaia2011}. The median study size was 1,143 patients, ranging from 115\cite{rijal2013} to 8,537 patients\cite{burza2014}. Two studies report outcomes from the same trial\cite{goyal2019,goyal2020}, although reported separately here given the variation in patient numbers and methodologies used. Follow-up periods ranged from 6 months to 4 years, with relapse proportions varying from 2.6\%\cite{lucero2015} to 20.9\%\cite{rijal2013}. Full details, including the wide range of study designs and methodologies are, where reported, presented in [Supplemental file].

Age, as a categorical variable with $\geq$2 levels, is the most frequently reported relapse determinant. All 11 studies consider age as a candidate predictor, of which eight studies demonstrate statistically significant (p<0.05) or borderline statistically significant (0.05$\leq$p<0.1) associations in the unadjusted models\cite{burza2014, goyal2019, goyal2020, lucero2015, ostyn2014, rijal2013,sundar2019,kajaia2011}. Where considered, age remains significant in all but one study in the adjusted models\cite{sundar2019}. In two ISC studies that divide age into $\geq$3 categories, a `U'-shaped relationship is seen, with increased relapse risk in younger (<5 years) and older ($\geq$40 or $\geq$45 years) groups\cite{burza2014, lucero2015}. The remaining studies show increased risk in the younger age groups only, defined variously as <12 years or <15 years in the ISC\cite{goyal2019, goyal2020, rijal2013,sundar2019}, or <1 year in the the study performed in Georgia\cite{kajaia2011}. Interestingly, the two East Africa studies do not identify age as a significant predictor of relapse\cite{gorski2010,kennedy2024}, although this may simply reflect reduced statistical power, with only 17 relapses in Kennedy et al\cite{kennedy2024}, or selection bias from incomplete matching of relapse and index cases\cite{gorski2010}. No studies explicitly model age as a continuous variable.

After age, spleen size is the next most frequently identified relapse determinant. Of the seven studies that consider spleen size, five and four studies report significant associations in the unadjusted and adjusted models, respectively\cite{burza2014, lucero2015, sundar2019,gorski2010,kajaia2011}. Heterogeneity is seen in the how and when spleen size is measured and modelled. For example, Lucero et al report a significant association between larger spleens at discharge and relapse (OR 1.27, 95\% CI: 1.10--1.47, per cm below lower costal margin). Sundar et al report an approximate doubling of the relapse odds in patients with an admission spleen size of over 4cm\cite{sundar2019}. Gorski et al find increased relapse odds in patients with larger spleen sizes at discharge \textit{and} admission, as measured by Hackett grade\cite{gorski2010}, and Kajaia et al report increased relapse risk with larger spleens at admission as measured by the Kandelaki splenometric method\cite{kajaia2011, meliia2006}. Instead of modelling absolute spleen sizes, Burza et al instead model the change in spleen size during admission, and found that patients with a reduction in spleen size of $\leq$0.5cm/day had a 1.7 (95\% CI: 1.1--2.5) higher odds of relapse compared to >0.5cm/day, with similar findings in the adjusted model\cite{burza2014}.

Of the six studies that consider symptom duration prior to diagnosis or treatment, four studies identify significant associations with relapse in both their adjusted and unadjusted models\cite{burza2014,goyal2019,goyal2020,kajaia2011}. In the ISC, Burza et al report that patients with $\leq$4 weeks of symptoms had a 1.6 (95\% CI: 1.0--2.8) and 2.3 (95\% CI: 1.2--4.8) higher odds of relapse compared to patients with 4--8 weeks and >8 weeks of symptoms, respectively, with similar effect sizes seen after adjusting for age, sex and change in spleen size\cite{burza2014}. Also in the ISC, Goyal et al demonstrate that, after adjusting for treatment and age, patients with symptom duration $\leq$8 weeks had a 3.3 (95\% CI: 1.3--8.4) higher odds of relapse compared to those with >8weeks of symptoms\cite{goyal2019}. When performing a time-to-event analysis in patients from the same study, those with a symptom duration of $\leq$8 weeks have a 3.6 (95\% CI: 1.4--9.1) higher relapse hazard compared to those with >8 weeks of symptoms\cite{goyal2020}. In contrast to these findings, Kajaia et al report that in Georgia, patients with symptom durations of $\geq$90 days had a 3.9 (95\% CI: 1.8--8.5) \textit{higher} relapse risk compared to those with <90 of symptoms, after adjusting for haemoglobin and age\cite{kajaia2011}. Kennedy et al considered symptom duration in their analysis, however it was not found to be a significant predictor of relapse, perhaps due to low statistical power\cite{kennedy2024}

Despite sex being considered in all studies, only three identify significant associations with relapse\cite{burza2014,ostyn2014,sundar2019}. All from the ISC, these studies report an approximate doubling of the relapse odds\cite{burza2014,sundar2019} or rate\cite{ostyn2014}, with similar effects sizes seen in both unadjusted and adjusted models.

Admission haemoglobin (Hb) levels are considered in eight studies\cite{burza2014,goyal2019,kajaia2011,kennedy2024,lucero2015,rijal2013, sundar2019} and reported as significant in three\cite{kajaia2011,kennedy2024,lucero2015}. When adjusting for age and sex, Lucero et al found a strong statistical association between relapse risk and low Hb, when considered on a linear scale (OR 1.40, 95\% CI: 1.09--1.72 and 1.45, 95\% CI: 1.15--1.85, per g/dL decrease, for admission and discharge Hb, respectively). However, in the fully adjusted model these associations did not retain significance. In the unadjusted analysis performed by Kajaia et al, a strong relationship between Hb and relapse was seen, with relapse found to be 12.0 (95\%CI: 4.1--34.8) times more likely in those with Hb <60g/l vs $\geq$80g/l. This relationship remained significant after adjusting for age and symptom duration.

Markers of malnutrition are variably defined across the 11 studies, although reporting is often unclear. Gorski et al and Burza et al create 2--3 malnutrition categories by combining body mass index (BMI) (age $\geq$19 years), BMI-for-age z-score (5--18 years), and weight-for-height z-score (<5 years)\cite{gorski2010,burza2014}. Lucero et al adopt a similar approach, combining weight-for-height z-score (height < 121cm), and BMI for adults\cite{lucero2015}. Goyal et al and Kennedy et al describe `severe wasting' and `malnutrition' categories respectively, although not otherwise defined\cite{goyal2019, kennedy2024}. Rijal et al and Sundar et al employ a single marker of malnutrition regardless of age; BMI and weight, respectively\cite{rijal2013,sundar2019}. Sundar et al is the only study showing a significant association between malnutrition and relapse at the p<0.05 level, with patients $\leq$30kg at higher risk vs. >30kg (OR 1.8, 95\% CI: 1.0--3.1) in the unadjusted model, and with a similar effect size after adjusting for spleen size and sex. Given Sundar et al recruited patients of all ages, inference of a causal association between malnutrition (weight) and relapse is likely confounded by age.

\subsubsection{HIV co-infection}

Relapse rates in patients with HIV co-infection often exceed 20--50\%\cite{cota2011,diro2019,burza2014a}, highlighting the importance of host immunity in achieving lasting cure.

Two systematic reviews were identified summarising relapse determinants in patients with HIV-VL co-infection from across 18 studies (Cota et al, 2011)\cite{cota2011} and 15 studies (Alemayehu et al, 2016)\cite{alemayehu2016}. Significant relapse determinants identified include: low baseline CD4\textsuperscript{+} T-cell counts (especially <100 cells/$\mu$L), previous history of VL relapse, lack of improvement in CD4\textsuperscript{+} T-cell counts at follow-up, absence of secondary prophylaxis, and timing of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation.

Subsequent to the publication of the systematic reviews, a number of important studies have shed further light on relapse determinants in HIV co-infection patients\cite{abongomera2017a,costa2023-hiv, diro2019}. In 2017, Abongomera et al presented the outcomes of a retrospective study of 146 co-infection patients treated at an MSF supported clinic in North West Ethiopia, 2008--2013. 44 (30.1\%) patients relapsed during study follow-up. In addition to timing of HAART initiation, further predictors of relapse included a high baseline tissue parasite load (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 6.63, CI: 2.64--16.63, 6+ vs $\leq$6+), and the finding of a large spleen on admission (borderline significant in the unadjusted analysis)\cite{abongomera2017a}.

In 2023, Costa et al published a prospective study of 169 co-infection patients from Maranhão, Brazil, 2013--2020. Here, 70 (41.1\%) patients relapsed during the 12 month follow-up period. The presence of baseline splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, previous VL relapse, HAART regimen, HAART duration, raised creatinine, and raised urea were all found to be statistically significant predictors of relapse in the unadjusted analysis\cite{costa2023-hiv}.

Curiously, and in contrast with studies reporting relapse predictors in immunocompetent patients, only one study was identified showing a statistically significant association between relapse and age. Burza et al demonstrate an approximate doubling of relapse hazard in patients $\geq$40 years using routinely collected data from MSF treatment centres between 2007 and 2012 in Bihar, India\cite{burza2014a}.

\subsubsection{Treatments}
\label{sec:treatments}

After HIV co-infection, treatment is arguably the second most important predictor of relapse. This is evidenced across a large number of clinical efficacy studies, where the most common reason for failing to achieve the primary outcome of `definitive cure' --  initial cure and relapse-free survival for 6 months  -- is often relapse \cite{alves2018, sundar2019, goyal2020, musa2012,musa2023}. Summarising the outcomes of all VL efficacy studies is clearly beyond the scope of this thesis, although a few observations merit discussion.

Firstly, as summarised by Chhajed et al, while there is considerable variation in relapse risk across treatment regimens, it is often seen that combination regimens are associated with reduced relapse risk compared to monotherapy regimens\cite{chhajed2024}. After adjusting for age and symptom duration, Goyal et al showed that in India, treatment with paromomycin and miltefosine combination therapy was associated with a significantly lower odds of relapse compared to single dose LAMB 10mg/kg (aOR 0.21, 95\% CI: 0.08--0.55). Similarly, in a large cohort study from Bangladesh, Mondal et al found that, with the exception of SSG and multiple-dose LAMB, combination therapies were associated with lower relapse rates compared to paromomycin and miltefosine monotherapies\cite{mondal2019}. A possible exception to this observation may be SSG/PM combination therapy when considering routinely collected MSF data from South Sudan. Based on data collected between 1999--2007, Gorski et al demonstrated an approximate doubling of the relapse odds in the SSG/PM group compared to the SSG monotherapy group (OR 2.08, 95\% 1.21--3.58)\cite{gorski2010}.

Secondly, drug dosing and duration are also important predictors of treatment failure and relapse. Chhajed et al demonstrated this at the aggregate level by performing meta-regression of relapse risk in the ISC against the dose of single-dose LAMB received, and showing that higher LAMB doses were associated with lower relapse risk (OR 0.81 per 1mg/kg increase, 95\% CI: 0.72--0.91)\cite{chhajed2024}.Similar relationships between dose and overall treatment failure (a lack of initial cure or subsequent relapse) has been shown under trial conditions for both LAMB\cite{khalil2014} and paromomycin\cite{musa2010, hailu2010}. Also in East Africa, in a paediatric pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model, Dorlo et al demonstrated an inverse relationship between miltefosine exposure and relapse hazard. With similar findings from the ISC\cite{dorlo2012}, these findings led to the optimism of paediatric miltefosine dosing with an allometric dosing algorithm\cite{dorlo2017, mbui2019}.

Lastly, both the intrinsic infectivity of the parasite strain and the development of drug resistance contribute to increasing rates of initial treatment failure and, where an initial treatment response occurs, subsequent relapse. The prototypical example is the emergence of antimony resistance in Bihar, India, where treatment failure and relapse rates following SSG rose from <5\% to >50\% during the 1980s and 1990s, despite incremental increases in dose and duration\cite{olliaro2005, sundar2001}. These failures have been attributed to confirmed antimonial resistance in \textit{Leishmania donovani} isolates\cite{jeddi2011}, as well as to the selective survival and transmission of more tolerant parasite populations under prolonged drug pressure\cite{vanaerschot2011}. Increasing relapse rates have therefore been proposed as a bellwether of emerging drug resistance\cite{vangriensven2024}. Increasing relapse rates were also observed following the widespread use of miltefosine in the ISC in the late 2000s, prompting concern for emerging resistance\cite{rijal2013, sundar2012, singh2016}. However, comparison of relapsing and non-relapsing strains revealed no evidence of resistance; and instead, relapsing strains were found to be more infectious\cite{rai2013}. More recently, Naylor-Leyland et al. reported a rising trend in relapse rates between 2001 and 2018 that could not be clearly attributed to patient factors, leading to suggestions of declining SSG/PM efficacy due to emerging resistance\cite{naylor-leyland2022}.

% Regardless of the treatment received, it is widely accepted that an effective host immunity is crucial to achieving lasting cure\cite{murray2005, khalil2005, franssen2021, alves2018}. In this context, the goal of treatment is not complete parasite eradication, but rather sufficient suppression of the parasite burden to facilitate reconstitution of the host's cell-mediated immune response and  subsequent parasite control.

\subsubsection{Biomarkers}

Since tissue aspirate sampling is invasive, substantial effort has been directed toward developing non-invasive biomarkers that can serve both a test of cure following treatment and as a diagnostic test of relapse\cite{WHO2024_Leishmaniasis}. In fact, a 2015 systematic review identified 53 biomarkers from 170 studies with potential to be used for monitoring post-treatment outcomes in \textit{Leishmaniasis}\cite{kip2015}. Biomarkers can be broadly categorised into two categories: (1) direct markers of parasite burden, including DNA/RNA and antigen detection; and (2) indirect markers of host immunity, such as antibodies, cytokines and acute-phase proteins.

% molecular techniques
The lion's share of VL biomarker literature focusses on the direct detection of \textit{Leishmania} DNA/RNA in both immunosuppressed\cite{antinori2007, bourgeois2008, cota2017, molina2013, nicodemo2013, verma2017} and immunocompetent patients\cite{hossain2017, mary2006, sudarshan2011, verrest2021, verrest2024}. In particular, real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) of kDNA, performed on the buffy coat of peripheral blood, has been confirmed as a strong predictor of relapse\cite{hossain2017, sudarshan2011, verrest2021, verrest2024}, although its use in routine practice is limited by the lack of local expertise and restrictive costs. In a recent landmark study by Verrest et al (2021), using qPCR measurements from 177 immunocompetent patients recruited into Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) trials in East Africa\footnote{LEAP 0714 (30 children with allometric miltefosine), LEAP 0208 (151 patients receiving miltefosine and LAMB combination regimens), FEXI VL 001 (14 patients receiving fexinidazole)}, it was shown that qPCR levels taken between treatment initiation to day 56 all significantly predicted relapse, with areas under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.71, 0.74 and 0.92 when performed on days 14, 28 and 56, respectively\cite{verrest2021}. With the same qPCR data, Verrest et al (2024) developed a semi-mechanistic population PK-PD model that characterised parasite replication, drug action, and subsequent post-treatment parasite clearance. The model successfully predicted relapse based on the modelled day 28 and 56 blood parasite loads, and provided the first direct evidence that relapse risk depends not only on initial parasite clearance during treatment, but also on the subsequent host immune response\cite{verrest2024}. Interestingly, inclusion of haematological and biochemical parameters,\footnote{including Hb, white blood cells (WBC), platelets and creatinine} did not explain the variation in post-treatment qPCR measurements.

% antigen tests
Beyond molecular testing, studies were identified showing an association between relapse and the amount of \textit{Leishmania} antigen in urine in HIV co-infection patients\cite{vangriensven2018, riera2004}. In Ethiopian patients, the degree of antigenuria at test of cure was strongly associated with with relapse over the following 12 months (HR 9.8, 95\% CI: 1.8--82.1 comparing 1--10 parasites/10 fields to no parasites detected with the KATex assay).

% serology
Post-treatment IgG subclass titres have been linked to relapse in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed individuals\cite{bhattacharyya2014, mondal2019-serology, mollett2019, kuschnir2021}. However, due to the long immunoglobulin half-life, their ability to prognosticate at the time of initial cure assessment remains uncertain. Similarly, studies have shown that asymptomatic patients with higher serological titres are more likely to progress to symptomatic infection\cite{chapman2015, vangriensven2024_preleish}.

% cytokines
Various studies have assessed non-serological and indirect biomarker panels to assess disease activity during asymptomatic infection, active disease, and post-treatment recovery\cite{samant2021, takele2022, tadesse2021, guedes2022, kip2018, torres2025}. In East African patients, Kip et al found that the change in the level of neopterin---a marker of macrophage activation---between end of treatment and day 60 of follow-up was predictive of relapse with an AOC of 0.84. In a subsequent study, based on a cohort of 34 Ethiopian HIV co-infection patients of whom half progressed to relapse, Takele et al showed in a multinomial logistic model that at the end of treatment, relapse was associated with (i) failure to restore antigen-specific production of IFN$\gamma$, (ii) persistently low CD4\textsuperscript{+} counts, and (iii) higher T-cell expression of PD1. These findings highlight the importance of cell-mediated immunity in achieving  sustained cure.

\subsection{Why is relapse important?}

Relapse is harmful at the individual level not only from the increased morbidity and mortality caused by the infection itself, but also from the potentially toxic second-line regimens. Excess direct and indirect costs, including loss of patient income due to prolonged hospital admissions, can impose significant financial strain on households already affected by poverty.

Relapse is also important from a public health perspective. In areas of anthroponotic transmission, early diagnosis and treatment of all infections, including relapses, is a core pillar of both the East Africa and ISC elimination programmes, and supported by mathematical modelling\cite{lerutte2017, WHO_KalaAzarElimination_2015, WHO_2024_VL_easternAfrica}.

Parasite strains isolated from relapse cases, however, are distinct from primary cases, and present additional challenges. For example, there is mounting evidence that relapse strains exhibit increased infectiousness, likely resulting from selection pressure during initial drug exposure\cite{rai2013,hendrickx2016, garcia-hernandez2015} (discussed further below in \ref{sec:treatments}). Additionally, relapse strains can harbour \textit{de novo} resistance mutations selected for during treatment, as has been observed in vitro across a range of drug classes\cite{vangriensven2024}, and often described in routine clinical practice \cite{mohammed2020, bourgeois2010}.
