\minitoc{}

\section{Introduction}

•	Brief recap of:
•	The four models
•	The systematic review
•	High-level summary of key findings:
•	Predictive performance
•	Consistently important predictors
•	Regional contrasts

•	Explicit statement of discussion aims and structure
•	Interpretation
•	Clinical relevance
•	Implementation feasibility

\section{Interpretation of Predictors and Causal Plausibility}

\subsection{Indian Subcontinent}
\subsection{East Africa}

•	Predictors consistently selected across regions
•	Predictors that diverge by geography

•	Biological and clinical plausibility:
•	Host factors
•	Treatment-related factors
•	Immunological hypotheses
•	Discussion of whether predictors are:
•	Causal
•	Proxies
•	Markers of unmeasured processes

\section{Implementation Considerations}

\subsection{Indian subcontinent}
•	Model performance and strengths
•	Key predictors and their regional relevance
•	Implications for:
•	Follow-up strategies
•	Targeted surveillance
•	Resource allocation

\subsection{East Africa}
•	Differences in predictors and performance
•	Role of:
•	Comorbidities
•	Treatment heterogeneity
•	Programmatic constraints
•	Implications for clinical and public health practice

5. Clinical and programmatic implementation considerations

(Strongly recommend keeping this separate)
•	Who would use these models?
•	At what point in the care pathway?
•	Data availability in routine care
•	Risks of misclassification
•	Ethical considerations:
•	Risk stratification
•	Stigma or differential care
•	Alignment with VL elimination goals

This section is especially valuable for examiners and policy-minded readers.

\section{Strengths}
\section{Limitations}

Your list is good; consider adding framing:
•	Data limitations
•	Trial populations
•	Missingness and measurement error
•	Methodological limitations
•	Overfitting
•	Outcome definition
•	Lack of time-to-event modelling
•	Conceptual limitations
•	Prediction vs causation
•	Immune mechanisms inferred but not measured

Explicitly note which limitations are unlikely vs likely to materially affect conclusions.

\section{Future Research}

Strong already. You could sharpen by grouping:
•	Methodological
•	Dynamic prediction models
•	Time-to-relapse modelling
•	Incorporation of biomarkers
•	Biological
•	Immune correlates of relapse
•	Implementation
•	Prospective validation
•	Impact studies
•	Stakeholder-driven refinement

\section{Conclusion}

•	One-two paragraph synthesis of:
•	What is now known that wasn't before
•	Why this matters for VL control
•	Explicit statement of contribution:
•	    Scientific
•	    Clinical
•	    Methodological

% summarise main story

% importance of relapse -> widespread recognition of urgent need to determine cure and monitor treatment response -> 
% prediction model for relapse -> currently no prediction models for relapse -> development of new relapse models!
