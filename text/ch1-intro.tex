\section{Motivation}
\subsection{Global importance of visceral leishmaniasis}
\subsection{Elimination targets}
\subsection{Why is relapse important?}

\section{Research gap}

1-2 paragraphs on our lack of understanding of relapse risk factors, and the need for better prediction of relapse risk in the context of current elimination programmes.

\section{Aims and objectives}

In this thesis I aim to explore and build upon our current understanding of risk factors for VL relapse, with a focus on how such an understanding can be applied improve clinical practice and inform public health policy.

To address this aim, this thesis will focus on the following objectives:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Review our current understanding of the determinants of VL treatment failure, with a focus on relapse
    \item Perform a systematic review of prognostic models predicting VL clinical outcomes
    \item Develop and internally validate prognostic models predicting VL relapse using individual participant data from clinical trials conducted in (i) the Indian subcontinent and (ii) East Africa
    \item Consider how identified risk factors for VL relapse can be interpreted from a mechanistic/causal viewpoint
    \item Discuss how identified risk factors can be applied to inform clinical decision making and public health policy in the context of VL elimination programmes
\end{itemize}
