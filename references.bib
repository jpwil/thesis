  abstract = {Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a systemic protozoan disease that is transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies. Poor and neglected populations in East Africa and the Indian sub-continent are particularly affected. Early and accurate diagnosis and treatment remain key components of VL control. In addition to improved diagnostic tests, accurate and simple tests are needed to identify treatment failures. Miltefosine, paromomycin and liposomal amphotericin B are gradually replacing pentavalent antimonials and conventional amphotericin B as the preferred treatments in some regions, but in other areas these drugs are still being evaluated in both mono- and combination therapies. New diagnostic tools and new treatment strategies will only have an impact if they are made widely available to patients.},

An estimated 0·7-1 million new cases of leishmaniasis per year are reported from nearly 100 endemic countries. The number of reported visceral leishmaniasis cases has decreased substantially in the past decade as a result of better access to diagnosis and treatment and more intense vector control within an elimination initiative in Asia, although natural cycles in transmission intensity might play a role. In east Africa however, the case numbers of this fatal disease continue to be sustained. Increased conflict in endemic areas of cutaneous leishmaniasis and forced displacement has resulted in a surge in these endemic areas as well as clinics across the world. WHO lists leishmaniasis as one of the neglected tropical diseases for which the development of new treatments is a priority. Major evidence gaps remain, and new tools are needed before leishmaniasis can be definitively controlled.},

Although considered anthroponotic, L. donovani infects other mammals susceptible to sand fly bites, including dogs. Aggressive strategies to reduce sand fly populations in India have led to flies seeking nonhuman hosts, so understanding the role of dogs in L. donovani transmission has become critical. Our study investigated L. donovani infection in dogs and the potential for such infections to be transmitted back to sand flies. We performed xenodiagnosis by using P. argentipes on dogs (n = 73) with quantitative PCR-detectible parasitemia in both endemic and outbreak villages. We found that 12\% (9/73) of dogs were infectious to sand flies during winter and rainy seasons. Patients with visceral leishmaniasis remain primary sources of L. donovani transmission, but our findings suggest a possible link between canine infection and human exposure.},

In India, VL is endemic, considered to be anthroponotic, and caused by Leishmania donovani . Anthroponotic diseases are maintained by transmission from human to human and to a lesser extent from human to animals. Serum samples from 1,220 animals from 7 human VL endemic districts of Bihar, India, were tested for antibodies to a recombinant kinetoplast antigen (rK39 antigen) present in amastigotes of visceralizing Leishmania species, i.e., L. donovani complex. Additionally, PCR was used to examine samples positive by rK39 antigen serology. Antibodies to rK39 indicative of VL were detected in 33 of 1,220 animals. Thirty-one of 867 goats (Capra hircus), 1 of 161 cattle (Bos indicus), and 1 of 54 wild rats (Rattus sp.) were positive by rK39 serology. None of 106 chickens (Gallus domesticus), 26 sheep (Ovis aries), 3 water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalus), or 3 dogs (Canis familiaris) was positive by rK39 serology. Leishmania donovani DNA was detected by PCR in 20 rK39 positive blood samples from goats and 1 sample from a cow. The present study indicates that goats are potential animal reservoirs of human VL in India.},

  abstract = {Climate change is having a substantial impact on our environment and ecosystems and has altered the way humans live, access, and utilize resources with increased risk of zoonotic infectious disease encounters. As global temperatures continue to increase, they impact on public health, migration, food security and land conflict, and as new environments become favorable, exposure to disease carrying vectors. Increased forests or natural habitat clearance for land repurposing, urbanization, road building, and water management are related to an increase in emerging vector borne parasitic diseases. The East African region remains one of the most impacted regions globally for leishmaniasis, a vector borne disease that impacts significantly on the health, wellbeing and livelihoods of affected communities and for which a lack of reporting and control interventions hinder progress toward elimination of this neglected tropical disease. As our world continues to transform, both politically and climatically, it is essential that measures are put in place to improve surveillance and disease management with implementation of control measures, including vector control, especially in low- and middle-income countries that are expected to be most impacted by changes in climate. Only through effective management, now, can we be sufficiently resilient to preventing the inevitable spread of vectors into suitable habitat and expansion of the geographical range of leishmaniasis. This review offers a current perspective on Leishmaniasis as an endemic disease in East Africa and examines the potential of the recent emergence of <i>Leishmania</i> infection in hitherto unaffected regions to become a public health concern if no disease management is achieved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A proportion of all immunocompetent patients treated for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) are known to relapse; however, the risk factors for relapse are not well understood. With the support of the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute (RMRI), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) implemented a program in Bihar, India, using intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome) as a first-line treatment for VL. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for VL relapse by examining the characteristics of immunocompetent patients who relapsed following this regimen.
              METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This is an observational retrospective cohort study of all VL patients treated by the MSF program from July 2007 to August 2012. Intravenous Ambisome was administered to 8749 patients with VL in four doses of 5 mg/kg (for a total dose of 20 mg/kg) over 4-10 days, depending on the severity of disease. Out of 8588 patients not known to be HIV-positive, 8537 (99.4\%) were discharged as initial cures, 24 (0.3\%) defaulted, and 27 (0.3\%) died during or immediately after treatment. In total, 1.4\% (n = 119) of the initial cured patients re-attended the programme with parasitologically confirmed VL relapse, with a median time to relapse of 10.1 months. Male sex, age {\textless}5 years and ≥45 years, a decrease in spleen size at time of discharge of ≤0.5 cm/day, and a shorter duration of symptoms prior to seeking treatment were significantly associated with relapse. Spleen size at admission, hemoglobin level, nutritional status, and previous history of relapse were not associated with relapse.
              CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest cohort of VL patients treated with Ambisome worldwide. The risk factors for relapse included male sex, age {\textless}5 and ≥45 years, a smaller decrease in splenomegaly at discharge, and a shorter duration of symptoms prior to seeking treatment. The majority of relapses in this cohort occurred 6-12 months following treatment, suggesting that a 1-year follow-up is appropriate in future studies.},

To understand these phenomena better, a systematic review was conducted, considering studies published between 1990 and 2021 in Portuguese, English, and Spanish. The review included 64 articles divided into three categories. Case reports (26 articles) focused on treatment failure and clinical relapse in cutaneous leishmaniasis patients (47.6%), primarily affecting males (74%) and children (67%), regardless of the clinical manifestation. Experimental studies on the parasite (19 articles), particularly with L. major (25%), indicated that alterations in DNA and genic expression (44.82%) played a significant role in treatment failure and clinical relapse. Population data on the human host (19 articles) identified immunological characteristics as the most associated factor (36%) with treatment failure and clinical relapse. Each clinical manifestation of the disease presented specificities in these phenomena, suggesting a multifactorial nature. Additionally, the parasites were found to adapt to the drugs used in treatment. In summary, the systematic review revealed that treatment failure and clinical relapse in leishmaniasis are complex processes influenced by various factors, including host immunology and parasite adaptation.},

                The Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO) data platform was launched in 2016 with the aim of harmonizing individual participant data (IPD) from clinical trials on infectious diseases, with a specific focus on neglected tropical diseases, including visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The VL data platform hosted by IDDO was developed in collaboration with researchers at the frontline of disease combat. This platform currently hosts IPD from more than 50 studies on VL and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). The platform remains a controlled open-access repository to the scientific community and is currently facilitating collaborative IPD meta-analyses addressing research questions regarding drug safety and efficacy. Further open-access resources maintained by IDDO include clinical case report forms (CRFs) for VL, and VL-human immunodeficiency trials, a comprehensive inventory of all published VL clinical trials (1980–to date) and PKDL trials (1973–-to date), and these are publicly available as downloadable resources to the research community. These open-access resources developed in collaboration with the scientific community can help in identifying research gaps, and facilitate the generation of new evidence, and the CRFs can help to harmonize data collection for future trials. In this study, we highlight some of the ongoing and past research activities undertaken using these open-access resources (such as predictors of relapse and the development of a clinical scoring system for detecting relapse) and how these can support generating evidence to complement the ongoing activities in the Indian subcontinent and East Africa to reach the elimination targets.},

  volume   = {5},
  issn     = {1176-6336},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is significant variation in Amphotericin B (AMB) efficacy and relapses in antimony unresponsive visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases over a period of time (10-15 years). Keeping in mind the above mentioned view this study was undertaken with an objective to assess the magnitude of cure and relapse rates of AMB in the treatment of antimony unresponsive VL cases.
              METHODS: In a controlled, randomized nonblinded clinical trial, we evaluated the cure and relapse rate of Amphotericin B deoxycholate as compared to pentamidine. A total of 82 sodium stibogluconate (SSG) unresponsive and parasitologically confirmed VL cases were included in this study and randomized into two groups, test (Amphotericin B) and control (Pentamidine). Both the groups were treated with recommended dosages (as per World Health Organization guidelines) of respective medicines. All the patients were followed up on 1st, 2nd, and 6th month after end of treatment.
              RESULTS: Apparent cure rate in the Amphotericin B group was found to be 95\% (39/41) compared with 83\% (34/41) in the Pentamidine group, which shows significant statistical difference (p = 0.05). The ultimate cure rate was found 92\% (38/41) in the Amphotericin B group compared to 73\% (30/41) in the Pentamidine group, which shows a significant statistical difference (Yates corrected chi-square = 4.42, p = 0.04). Similarly, significant statistical difference was observed in the relapse rate of the Amphotericin group compared to the Pentamidine group (p = 0.03).
              CONCLUSIONS: AMB may still be the drug of choice in the management of resistant VL cases in Bihar, India. This is due to its consistent apparent cure rate (95\%), low relapse rate (2.5\%), and cost effectiveness compared with other available antileishmanial drugs. It is a safe drug even in case of pregnancy. Efforts should be taken to form a future strategy so that this drug and coming newer drugs do not meet a similar fate as has happened to SSG and pentamidine over a span of 10-15 years.},

East Africa is second to the Indian subcontinent in the global VL caseload and first in VL-HIV coinfection rate. Because of the alteration in the disease course, the diagnostic challenges, and the poor treatment responses, VL with HIV coinfection has become a very serious challenge in East Africa today. Field experience with the use of liposomal amphotericin B in combination with miltefosine, followed by secondary prophylaxis and antiretroviral drugs, looks promising. However, this needs to be confirmed through clinical trials. Better diagnostic and follow-up methods for relapse and prediction of relapse should also be looked for. Basic research to understand the immunological interaction of the two infections may ultimately help to improve the management of the coinfection.},

There are studies which have evaluated efficacy and safety of liposomal amphotericin B for visceral leishmaniasis in all age groups. However, the only study that specifically addressed treatment of childhood visceral leishmaniasis did not include all ages or document renal and liver function. We, therefore, felt it was important to reassess the efficacy and safety of single dose liposomal amphotericin B in children and adolescents. A total of 100 parasitologically confirmed visceral leishmaniasis patients aged {\textless} 15 years were included in this study. Participants consisted of 65 males and 35 females. All of them had come from the endemic region of Bihar. They were administered one dose intravenous infusion of liposomal amphptericin B at 10 mg/kg body weight. Efficacy was assessed as initial and final cure at 1 and 6 months, respectively, and safety of all participants who were recruited in the study. The initial and final cure rate by per protocol analysis was 100\% and 97.9\%, respectively. Chills and rigors were the most commonly occurring adverse events (AEs). All the AEs were mild in intensity, and none of the patients experienced any serious AEs. No patients developed nephrotoxicity. Our finding indicates that liposomal amphotericin B at 10 mg/kg body weight is safe and effective in children. Results of our study support the use of single dose liposomal amphotericin B in all age group populations for elimination of kala-azar from the Indian subcontinent.},

Miltefosine is an oral drug which was used as a topical application for skin metastasis of breast cancer. It was found to be effective against
              Leishmania donovani
              . The main adverse events (AE) reported previously with miltefosine use includes diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. Other AEs include, raised serum alanine transaminase/aspartate aminotransferase and renal parameters such as creatinine. In this study, we report AEs in a large patient cohort of VL treated with miltefosine. The purpose of this pharmacovigilance study was to assess adverse drug reactions (ADRs)/AE of miltefosine treatment under unrestricted condition in the field setup. Patients were followed up to 6 months for therapeutic effectiveness. Outcomes of a larger data set of patients treated with this regimen from April 2012 to March 2015 were recorded. In the present study, 646 patients of VL were given miltefosine. Majority of the study subjects (58\%) were male. Relapse occurred in 7\% during follow-up period. Main causes of death were VL–pulmonary tuberculosis coinfection, extreme diarrhea, and acute pancreatitis which were reported in 1.7\% subjects. Of 553 (85.6\%) patients completing full course of treatment, 463 (83.7\%) showed ADR with miltefosine during the study period. About 2.3\% were suffering severe ADR, 51\% from moderate, and the rest had mild ADR. The initial and final cure rate was 97.4\% and 85.6\%, respectively.},

We evaluated miltefosine in a phase IV trial of 977 patients in Bangladesh. At the six-month final follow up, 701 were cured. 24 showed initial treatment failure, and 95 showed treatment failure at 6 months, although 73 of the 95 showed treatment failure solely by the criterion of low hemoglobin values. One hundred twenty-one patients were not assessable. With the conservative assumption that all low hemoglobin values represented treatment failure, the final per protocol cure rate was 85\%. Of 13 severe adverse events, 6 led to treatment discontinuation and 7 resulted in deaths, but only 1 death (associated with diarrhea) could be attributed to drug. Nearly all non-serious adverse events were gastrointestinal: vomiting in 25\% of patients and diarrhea in 8\% of patients. Oral miltefosine is an attractive alternative to intramuscular antimony and intravenous amphotericin B for treatment of kala-azar in Bangladesh.},

  doi      = {10.1128/mBio.00611-13},
  abstract = {Leishmania donovani is an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes leishmaniasis, which can range from a self-healing cutaneous disease to a fatal visceral disease depending on the infecting species. Miltefosine is currently the latest and only oral antileishmanial that came out of drug discovery pipelines in the past few decades, but recent reports indicate a significant decline in its efficacy against visceral leishmaniasis (also known as kala-azar) in the Indian subcontinent. This relapse rate of up to 20\% within 12 months after treatment was shown not to be related to reinfection, drug quality, drug exposure, or drug-resistant parasites. We therefore aimed to assess other phenotypes of the parasite that may affect treatment outcome and found a significant association between the number of metacyclic parasites, parasite infectivity, and patient treatment outcome in the Indian subcontinent. Together with previous studies on resistance of L. donovani against pentavalent antimonials, these data suggest that the infectivity of the parasite, or related phenotypes, might be a more determinant factor for treatment failure in visceral leishmaniasis than drug susceptibility, warranting a reassessment of our current view on treatment failure and drug resistance in leishmaniasis and beyond.
              IMPORTANCE: The high miltefosine relapse rate poses a major challenge for the current Kala-Azar Elimination Program in the Indian subcontinent and other leishmaniasis control programs worldwide. This relapse rate could not be related to reinfection, drug-resistant parasites, or reduced treatment quality. Here we report that an increased infectivity of the parasite is associated with miltefosine relapse of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients. These results supplement those obtained with antimonial-resistant L. donovani where an increased infectivity was also observed. This challenges the current view of Leishmania drug susceptibility being the biggest parasitic factor that contributes to treatment failure in leishmaniasis. These selected more infectious parasites may pose an additional burden to leishmaniasis control programs, highlighting the importance of multifaceted control measures to achieve leishmaniasis elimination in the Indian subcontinent and other regions where leishmaniasis is endemic.},

  abstract  = {Many modern estimators require bootstrapping to calculate confidence intervals because either no analytic standard error is available or the distribution of the parameter of interest is nonsymmetric. It remains however unclear how to obtain valid bootstrap inference when dealing with multiple imputation to address missing data. We present 4 methods that are intuitively appealing, easy to implement, and combine bootstrap estimation with multiple imputation. We show that 3 of the 4 approaches yield valid inference, but that the performance of the methods varies with respect to the number of imputed data sets and the extent of missingness. Simulation studies reveal the behavior of our approaches in finite samples. A topical analysis from HIV treatment research, which determines the optimal timing of antiretroviral treatment initiation in young children, demonstrates the practical implications of the 4 methods in a sophisticated and realistic setting. This analysis suffers from missing data and uses theg‐formula for inference, a method for which no standard errors are available.},

  abstract   = {Introduction:
                Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector-borne disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. The disease is endemic in parts of South Asia, East Africa, South America and the Mediterranean region, with an estimated 50,000 to 90,000 cases occurring annually. A living systematic review of existing scientific literature is proposed to identify clinical drug efficacy studies against VL, conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic-Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
                
                
                Methods and analysis:
                The proposed living systematic review builds on a previous systematic review first carried out in 2016, and the current protocol is designed to capture any published or registered VL clinical study from Nov-2021 onwards. The following databases will be searched by a medical librarian: PubMed, Ovid Embase, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, clinicaltrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, as well as IMEMR, IMSEAR, and LILACS from the WHO Global Index Medicus. The systematic review will consider both randomised and non-randomised interventional studies, including single-armed studies.
                
                
                Ethics and dissemination:
                A database of eligible studies, including study characteristics, is openly available (
                https://www.iddo.org/tool/vl-surveyor
                ) and will be continually updated every six months. All findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

  abstract   = {If individual participant data are available from multiple studies or clusters, then a prediction model can be externally validated multiple times. This allows the model’s discrimination and calibration performance to be examined across different settings. Random-effects meta-analysis can then be used to quantify overall (average) performance and heterogeneity in performance. This typically assumes a normal distribution of ‘true’ performance across studies. We conducted a simulation study to examine this normality assumption for various performance measures relating to a logistic regression prediction model. We simulated data across multiple studies with varying degrees of variability in baseline risk or predictor effects and then evaluated the shape of the between-study distribution in the C-statistic, calibration slope, calibration-in-the-large, and E/O statistic, and possible transformations thereof. We found that a normal between-study distribution was usually reasonable for the calibration slope and calibration-in-the-large; however, the distributions of the C-statistic and E/O were often skewed across studies, particularly in settings with large variability in the predictor effects. Normality was vastly improved when using the logit transformation for the C-statistic and the log transformation for E/O, and therefore we recommend these scales to be used for meta-analysis. An illustrated example is given using a random-effects meta-analysis of the performance of QRISK2 across 25 general practices.},

The effect estimate was computed as the geometric mean of the risk ratios for seroconversion for each cluster pair (net/no net), with its 95\% confidence interval. Formal tests of effect of no intervention were obtained with a paired t test.Results There was no significant difference in the risk of seroconversion over 24 months in intervention (5.4\%; 347/6372) compared with control (5.5\%; 345/6319 people) clusters (risk ratio 0.90, 95\% confidence interval 0.49 to 1.65) nor in the risk of clinical visceral leishmaniasis (0.99, 0.46 to 1.40). Adjustment for covariates did not alter these conclusions.Conclusions There is no evidence that large scale distribution of longlasting insecticidal nets provides additional protection against visceral leishmaniasis compared with existing control practice in the Indian subcontinent. The observed effect was small and not significant, though the confidence intervals did not exclude a 50\% change in either direction. Trial registration Clinical Trials NCT 2005-015374.},

  abstract  = {Summary
               Amphotericin B (AB) deoxycholate is highly effective in antimony refractory cases for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Bihar. But the need for prolonged hospitalisation and frequent, occasionally serious, adverse events are its major drawbacks. Lipid formulations of AB are devoid of these problems, but very expensive. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of a commercial standardised amphotericin B emulsion, a product of AB formulated in lipid emulsion vehicle (ABLE) in the treatment of Indian VL. In this open label, non‐comparative study, 15 patients in each group were given three daily intravenous infusions each of 3, 4 or 5 mg/kg. All 45 patients (15 in each group) completed the treatment. The drug was tolerated well. Infusion reactions occurred in 5 (11\%) patients and vomiting in 2 (4.4\%). No nephrotoxicity or other organ toxicity was observed. At the end of treatment all patients of every group were clinically and parasitologically cured. However, during 6 months follow up, three patients from the 5 mg/kg group and one from the 4 mg/kg group tested positive for splenic aspirate. Thus 41 (91.1\%; 95\% CI 78–97) of 45 patients were cured with a total dose ranging between 9 and 15 mg/kg. There was no dose response linear correlation. In this preliminary study, AB formulated in a lipid emulsion vehicle was safe and effective for the treatment of VL in India.

               Le deoxycholate d’amphotéricine B (AB) est très efficace dans les cas réfractaires à l’antimoine pour le traitement de la leishmaniose viscérale (LV) à Bihar. Mais la nécessité d’une hospitalisation prolongée et fréquente, parfois grave et les effets indésirables sont des inconvénients majeurs. Les formulations lipidiques d’AB sont dépourvues de ces problèmes, mais sont très coûteuses. Nous avons évalué la sécurité et l’efficacité d’une émulsion commerciale standardisée d’AB, un produit à base d’AB formulé dans un véhicule àémulsion lipidique pour le traitement de la LV indienne. Dans cette étude ouverte, non comparative, 15 patients dans chaque groupe ont reçu trois perfusions intraveineuses quotidiennes contenant chacune 3, 4 ou 5 mg/kg. Tous les 45 patients (15 dans chaque groupe) ont complété le traitement. Le médicament était bien toléré. Des réactions liées à la perfusion ont eu lieu chez 5 (11\%) et des vomissements chez 2 (4,4\%) patients. Aucune néphrotoxicité ou des toxicités dans d’autres organes n’ont été observées. À la fin du traitement tous les patients de chaque groupe étaient cliniquement et parasitologiquement guéris. Cependant, 6 mois après, 3 patients du groupe ayant reçu 5 mg/kg et 1 du groupe à 4 mg/kg ont été testés positifs pour l’aspiration de la rate. Ainsi, 41 (91,1\%; IC95\%: 78–97) des 45 patients ont été guéris avec une dose totale comprise entre 9–15 mg/kg. Il n’y avait pas de corrélation dose‐réponse linéaire. Dans cette étude préliminaire, l’AB formulé dans un véhicule àémulsion lipidique s’est avérée sûre et efficace pour le traitement de la LV en Inde.

Pero la necesidad de hospitalización prolongada y efectos adversos frecuentes, y ocasionalmente serios, son los principales inconvenientes. Las formulaciones lipídicas de AB están exentas de estos problemas, pero son muy caras. Hemos evaluado la seguridad y la eficacia de una emulsión comercial estandarizada de Amfotericina B, un producto de ABformulado en un vehículo de emulsión lipídico (ABEL) para el tratamiento de la LV hindú. En este estudio abierto, no comparativo, se les dio a 15 pacientes de cada grupo tres infusiones intravenosas diarias, cada una de 3, 4 o 5 mg/kg. Los 45 pacientes (15 en cada grupo) completaron el tratamiento. El medicamento fue bien tolerado. En 5 (11\%) pacientes ocurrió una reacción a la infusión y 2 (4.4\%) tuvieron vómitos. No se observó nefrotoxicidad o toxicidad en otro órgano. Al final del tratamiento, todos los pacientes de cada grupo estaban clínica y parasitológicamente curados. Sin embargo, trás 6 meses, 3 pacientes del grupo de 5 mg/kg y 1 del grupo de 4 mg/kg dió positivo para el aspirado esplénico. Por lo tanto 41 (91.1\%; 95\% IC 78–97) de los 45 pacientes se curaron con rangos de dosis totales de 9–15 mg/kg. No se observó una correlación linear dosis‐respuesta. En este estudio preliminar, el AB formulado con un vehículo de emulsión lipídica fue seguro y efectivo para el tratamiento de LV en India.},

In this study, we used a higher-dose regimen of an indigenously manufactured liposomal amphotericin B (FUNGISOME; L-AmBL), which was intended to improve the efficacy in terms of long-lasting cure rate. Thirty men and thirty women between 12 and 60 years old with parasitologically confirmed visceral leishmaniasis were enrolled in two cohorts of 15 patients each. Subjects in cohort I were administered one dose (10 mg/kg body weight) of L-AmBL intravenously. After the safety at this dose was confirmed in cohort I, patients were recruited in cohort II. They received one infusion of an escalated dose (15 mg/kg body weight). The safety of these two doses was evaluated over a period of 30 days, and efficacy was assessed for initial cure at day 30 and definitive cure at 6 months. FUNGISOME was found to be safe, with an initial cure rate of 100\% at day 30 and a definitive cure rate of 93.3\% at the 6-month follow-up in both the cohorts.},

Simple ad-hoc fixes, like deletion or mean imputation, only work under highly restrictive conditions, which are often not met in practice. Multiple imputation replaces each missing value by multiple plausible values. The variability between these replacements reflects our ignorance of the true (but missing) value. Each of the completed data set is then analyzed by standard methods, and the results are pooled to obtain unbiased estimates with correct confidence intervals. Multiple imputation is a general approach that also inspires novel solutions to old problems by reformulating the task at hand as a missing-data problem. This is the second edition of a popular book on multiple imputation, focused on explaining the application of methods through detailed worked examples using the MICE package as developed by the author. This new edition incorporates the recent developments in this fast-moving field. This class-tested book avoids mathematical and technical details as much as possible: formulas are accompanied by verbal statements that explain the formula in accessible terms. The book sharpens the reader’s intuition on how to think about missing data, and provides all the tools needed to execute a well-grounded quantitative analysis in the presence of missing data},

The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;mice&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;mice&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;mice&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

  abstract   = {Abstract
                Multiple imputation by chained equations is a flexible and practical approach to handling missing data. We describe the principles of the method and show how to impute categorical and quantitative variables, including skewed variables. We give guidance on how to specify the imputation model and how many imputations are needed. We describe the practical analysis of multiply imputed data, including model building and model checking. We stress the limitations of the method and discuss the possible pitfalls. We illustrate the ideas using a data set in mental health, giving Stata code fragments.

  abstract = {Background Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease prevalent in populations affected by poverty and poor nutrition. Without treatment, death is the norm. Prognostic models can steer important management decisions by identifying patients at high-risk of adverse outcomes. We therefore aim to identify, summarise, and appraise the available prognostic models predicting clinical outcomes in VL patients. Methods We reviewed all published studies that developed, validated, or updated models predicting clinical outcomes in VL patients. Five bibliographic databases were searched from database inception to March 1st 2023 with no language restriction. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed in duplicate. Findings are presented with tables, figures, and a narrative review. Results Eight studies, published 2003-21, were identified describing 12 model developments and 19 external validations. All models predicted either in-hospital mortality (n=10 models) or registry-reported mortality (n=2), and were developed in either Brazilian or East African settings (n=9 and n=3 models respectively). Model discrimination (c-statistic) ranged from 0.62-0.92 when evaluated in new data (19 external validations, 10 models). Risk of bias was high for all model developments and validations: no studies presented calibration plots, 11 models were at high risk of overfitting due to small sample sizes, and six models presented risk scores that were inconsistent with reported regression coefficients. Conclusion With a high risk of bias identified for all models, caution must be exercised when interpreting model predictions and performance measures. Prior to model development or validation, we encourage investigators to review model reporting guidelines. No prognostic models were identified predicting treatment failure or relapse. Furthermore, despite South Asia representing the highest VL burden pre-2010, no models were developed in this population. In the context of the current South Asia elimination programme, these represent important evidence gaps where new model development should be prioritised.},

The purpose of the guideline is to improve the diagnosis of anaemia, grounded in gender, equity and human rights approaches, with the aim of leaving no one behind, thereby informing the development of nutrition and health policies. The normative statements in this guideline are intended for a wide audience, including policy-makers, their expert advisers, and technical and programme staff at ministries and organizations involved in the design, implementation, and scaling-up of actions for addressing anaemia. Other end-users of the guideline include nongovernmental and other organizations and professional societies involved in the planning and management of anaemia actions, as well as health professionals including clinicians, managers of nutrition and health programmes, national blood services, and public health policy-makers in all settings},

There are few available treatments and antimonials are still of major importance in the therapeutic strategies used in most endemic regions. However, resistance toward these compounds has recently emerged in areas where the replacement of these drugs is mainly limited by the cost of alternative molecules. In this paper, we reviewed the studies carried out on antimonial resistance in                Leishmania                . Several common limitations of these works are presented before prevalent approaches to evidence antimonial resistance are related. Afterwards, phenotypic determination of resistance is described, then confronted to clinical outcome. Finally, we detail molecular mechanisms and targets involved in resistance and already identified                in vitro                within selected mutant strains or in clinical isolates.},

We observed a large range of parasitemias, more than 9 log values, and could determine the threshold between asymptomatic carriage and disease in the Mediterranean area (approximately one parasite/mL of blood). Based on kinetoplast DNA amplification, this assay had a sensitivity of 0.001 parasite DNA equivalents/mL and detected asymptomatic carriage of Leishmania. It detected parasite DNA in 58% of healthy subjects, while an immunoblot detected specific antibodies in only 16%. For initial diagnosis of disease, this quantitative PCR with blood samples constitutes a non-invasive alternative to bone marrow aspiration. Its main applications are monitoring of drug therapy and follow-up of immunodeficient patients for biologic confirmation of relapses.},

  abstract   = {Clinical risk prediction models are increasingly being developed and validated on multicenter datasets. In this article, we present a comprehensive framework for the evaluation of the predictive performance of prediction models at the center level and the population level, considering population-averaged predictions, center-specific predictions, and predictions assuming an average random center effect. We demonstrated in a simulation study that calibration slopes do not only deviate from one because of over- or underfitting of patterns in the development dataset, but also as a result of the choice of the model (standard versus mixed effects logistic regression), the type of predictions (marginal versus conditional versus assuming an average random effect), and the level of model validation (center versus population). In particular, when data is heavily clustered (ICC 20\%), center-specific predictions offer the best predictive performance at the population level and the center level. We recommend that models should reflect the data structure, while the level of model validation should reflect the research question.},
