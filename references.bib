  abstract = {Leishmaniasis is a poverty-related disease with two main clinical forms: visceral leishmaniasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis. An estimated 0·7-1 million new cases of leishmaniasis per year are reported from nearly 100 endemic countries. The number of reported visceral leishmaniasis cases has decreased substantially in the past decade as a result of better access to diagnosis and treatment and more intense vector control within an elimination initiative in Asia, although natural cycles in transmission intensity might play a role. In east Africa however, the case numbers of this fatal disease continue to be sustained. Increased conflict in endemic areas of cutaneous leishmaniasis and forced displacement has resulted in a surge in these endemic areas as well as clinics across the world. WHO lists leishmaniasis as one of the neglected tropical diseases for which the development of new treatments is a priority. Major evidence gaps remain, and new tools are needed before leishmaniasis can be definitively controlled.},

Although considered anthroponotic, L. donovani infects other mammals susceptible to sand fly bites, including dogs. Aggressive strategies to reduce sand fly populations in India have led to flies seeking nonhuman hosts, so understanding the role of dogs in L. donovani transmission has become critical. Our study investigated L. donovani infection in dogs and the potential for such infections to be transmitted back to sand flies. We performed xenodiagnosis by using P. argentipes on dogs (n = 73) with quantitative PCR-detectible parasitemia in both endemic and outbreak villages. We found that 12\% (9/73) of dogs were infectious to sand flies during winter and rainy seasons. Patients with visceral leishmaniasis remain primary sources of L. donovani transmission, but our findings suggest a possible link between canine infection and human exposure.},

In India, VL is endemic, considered to be anthroponotic, and caused by Leishmania donovani . Anthroponotic diseases are maintained by transmission from human to human and to a lesser extent from human to animals. Serum samples from 1,220 animals from 7 human VL endemic districts of Bihar, India, were tested for antibodies to a recombinant kinetoplast antigen (rK39 antigen) present in amastigotes of visceralizing Leishmania species, i.e., L. donovani complex. Additionally, PCR was used to examine samples positive by rK39 antigen serology. Antibodies to rK39 indicative of VL were detected in 33 of 1,220 animals. Thirty-one of 867 goats (Capra hircus), 1 of 161 cattle (Bos indicus), and 1 of 54 wild rats (Rattus sp.) were positive by rK39 serology. None of 106 chickens (Gallus domesticus), 26 sheep (Ovis aries), 3 water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalus), or 3 dogs (Canis familiaris) was positive by rK39 serology. Leishmania donovani DNA was detected by PCR in 20 rK39 positive blood samples from goats and 1 sample from a cow. The present study indicates that goats are potential animal reservoirs of human VL in India.},

  abstract = {Climate change is having a substantial impact on our environment and ecosystems and has altered the way humans live, access, and utilize resources with increased risk of zoonotic infectious disease encounters. As global temperatures continue to increase, they impact on public health, migration, food security and land conflict, and as new environments become favorable, exposure to disease carrying vectors. Increased forests or natural habitat clearance for land repurposing, urbanization, road building, and water management are related to an increase in emerging vector borne parasitic diseases. The East African region remains one of the most impacted regions globally for leishmaniasis, a vector borne disease that impacts significantly on the health, wellbeing and livelihoods of affected communities and for which a lack of reporting and control interventions hinder progress toward elimination of this neglected tropical disease. As our world continues to transform, both politically and climatically, it is essential that measures are put in place to improve surveillance and disease management with implementation of control measures, including vector control, especially in low- and middle-income countries that are expected to be most impacted by changes in climate. Only through effective management, now, can we be sufficiently resilient to preventing the inevitable spread of vectors into suitable habitat and expansion of the geographical range of leishmaniasis. This review offers a current perspective on Leishmaniasis as an endemic disease in East Africa and examines the potential of the recent emergence of <i>Leishmania</i> infection in hitherto unaffected regions to become a public health concern if no disease management is achieved.},

  abstractnote = {Overemphasis on hypothesis testing--and the use of P values to dichotomise significant or non-significant results--has detracted from more useful approaches to interpreting study results, such as estimation and confidence intervals. In medical studies investigators are usually interested in determining the size of difference of a measured outcome between groups, rather than a simple indication of whether or not it is statistically significant. Confidence intervals present a range of values, on the basis of the sample data, in which the population value for such a difference may lie. Some methods of calculating confidence intervals for means and differences between means are given, with similar information for proportions. The paper also gives suggestions for graphical display. Confidence intervals, if appropriate to the type of study, should be used for major findings in both the main text of a paper and its abstract.},

  issn     = {1935-2735},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A proportion of all immunocompetent patients treated for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) are known to relapse; however, the risk factors for relapse are not well understood. With the support of the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute (RMRI), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) implemented a program in Bihar, India, using intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome) as a first-line treatment for VL. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for VL relapse by examining the characteristics of immunocompetent patients who relapsed following this regimen.
              METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This is an observational retrospective cohort study of all VL patients treated by the MSF program from July 2007 to August 2012. Intravenous Ambisome was administered to 8749 patients with VL in four doses of 5 mg/kg (for a total dose of 20 mg/kg) over 4-10 days, depending on the severity of disease. Out of 8588 patients not known to be HIV-positive, 8537 (99.4\%) were discharged as initial cures, 24 (0.3\%) defaulted, and 27 (0.3\%) died during or immediately after treatment. In total, 1.4\% (n = 119) of the initial cured patients re-attended the programme with parasitologically confirmed VL relapse, with a median time to relapse of 10.1 months. Male sex, age {\textless}5 years and ≥45 years, a decrease in spleen size at time of discharge of ≤0.5 cm/day, and a shorter duration of symptoms prior to seeking treatment were significantly associated with relapse. Spleen size at admission, hemoglobin level, nutritional status, and previous history of relapse were not associated with relapse.
              CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest cohort of VL patients treated with Ambisome worldwide. The risk factors for relapse included male sex, age {\textless}5 and ≥45 years, a smaller decrease in splenomegaly at discharge, and a shorter duration of symptoms prior to seeking treatment. The majority of relapses in this cohort occurred 6-12 months following treatment, suggesting that a 1-year follow-up is appropriate in future studies.},

To understand these phenomena better, a systematic review was conducted, considering studies published between 1990 and 2021 in Portuguese, English, and Spanish. The review included 64 articles divided into three categories. Case reports (26 articles) focused on treatment failure and clinical relapse in cutaneous leishmaniasis patients (47.6%), primarily affecting males (74%) and children (67%), regardless of the clinical manifestation. Experimental studies on the parasite (19 articles), particularly with L. major (25%), indicated that alterations in DNA and genic expression (44.82%) played a significant role in treatment failure and clinical relapse. Population data on the human host (19 articles) identified immunological characteristics as the most associated factor (36%) with treatment failure and clinical relapse. Each clinical manifestation of the disease presented specificities in these phenomena, suggesting a multifactorial nature. Additionally, the parasites were found to adapt to the drugs used in treatment. In summary, the systematic review revealed that treatment failure and clinical relapse in leishmaniasis are complex processes influenced by various factors, including host immunology and parasite adaptation.},

  title    = {A controlled, randomized nonblinded clinical trial to assess the efficacy of amphotericin {B} deoxycholate as compared to pentamidine for the treatment of antimony unresponsive visceral leishmaniasis cases in {Bihar}, {India}},
  volume   = {5},
  issn     = {1176-6336},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is significant variation in Amphotericin B (AMB) efficacy and relapses in antimony unresponsive visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases over a period of time (10-15 years). Keeping in mind the above mentioned view this study was undertaken with an objective to assess the magnitude of cure and relapse rates of AMB in the treatment of antimony unresponsive VL cases.
              METHODS: In a controlled, randomized nonblinded clinical trial, we evaluated the cure and relapse rate of Amphotericin B deoxycholate as compared to pentamidine. A total of 82 sodium stibogluconate (SSG) unresponsive and parasitologically confirmed VL cases were included in this study and randomized into two groups, test (Amphotericin B) and control (Pentamidine). Both the groups were treated with recommended dosages (as per World Health Organization guidelines) of respective medicines. All the patients were followed up on 1st, 2nd, and 6th month after end of treatment.
              RESULTS: Apparent cure rate in the Amphotericin B group was found to be 95\% (39/41) compared with 83\% (34/41) in the Pentamidine group, which shows significant statistical difference (p = 0.05). The ultimate cure rate was found 92\% (38/41) in the Amphotericin B group compared to 73\% (30/41) in the Pentamidine group, which shows a significant statistical difference (Yates corrected chi-square = 4.42, p = 0.04). Similarly, significant statistical difference was observed in the relapse rate of the Amphotericin group compared to the Pentamidine group (p = 0.03).
              CONCLUSIONS: AMB may still be the drug of choice in the management of resistant VL cases in Bihar, India. This is due to its consistent apparent cure rate (95\%), low relapse rate (2.5\%), and cost effectiveness compared with other available antileishmanial drugs. It is a safe drug even in case of pregnancy. Efforts should be taken to form a future strategy so that this drug and coming newer drugs do not meet a similar fate as has happened to SSG and pentamidine over a span of 10-15 years.},

  abstract = {Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is an important protozoan opportunistic disease in HIV patients in endemic areas. East Africa is second to the Indian subcontinent in the global VL caseload and first in VL-HIV coinfection rate. Because of the alteration in the disease course, the diagnostic challenges, and the poor treatment responses, VL with HIV coinfection has become a very serious challenge in East Africa today. Field experience with the use of liposomal amphotericin B in combination with miltefosine, followed by secondary prophylaxis and antiretroviral drugs, looks promising. However, this needs to be confirmed through clinical trials. Better diagnostic and follow-up methods for relapse and prediction of relapse should also be looked for. Basic research to understand the immunological interaction of the two infections may ultimately help to improve the management of the coinfection.},

There are studies which have evaluated efficacy and safety of liposomal amphotericin B for visceral leishmaniasis in all age groups. However, the only study that specifically addressed treatment of childhood visceral leishmaniasis did not include all ages or document renal and liver function. We, therefore, felt it was important to reassess the efficacy and safety of single dose liposomal amphotericin B in children and adolescents. A total of 100 parasitologically confirmed visceral leishmaniasis patients aged {\textless} 15 years were included in this study. Participants consisted of 65 males and 35 females. All of them had come from the endemic region of Bihar. They were administered one dose intravenous infusion of liposomal amphptericin B at 10 mg/kg body weight. Efficacy was assessed as initial and final cure at 1 and 6 months, respectively, and safety of all participants who were recruited in the study. The initial and final cure rate by per protocol analysis was 100\% and 97.9\%, respectively. Chills and rigors were the most commonly occurring adverse events (AEs). All the AEs were mild in intensity, and none of the patients experienced any serious AEs. No patients developed nephrotoxicity. Our finding indicates that liposomal amphotericin B at 10 mg/kg body weight is safe and effective in children. Results of our study support the use of single dose liposomal amphotericin B in all age group populations for elimination of kala--azar from the Indian subcontinent.},

Miltefosine is an oral drug which was used as a topical application for skin metastasis of breast cancer. It was found to be effective against
              Leishmania donovani
              . The main adverse events (AE) reported previously with miltefosine use includes diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. Other AEs include, raised serum alanine transaminase/aspartate aminotransferase and renal parameters such as creatinine. In this study, we report AEs in a large patient cohort of VL treated with miltefosine. The purpose of this pharmacovigilance study was to assess adverse drug reactions (ADRs)/AE of miltefosine treatment under unrestricted condition in the field setup. Patients were followed up to 6 months for therapeutic effectiveness. Outcomes of a larger data set of patients treated with this regimen from April 2012 to March 2015 were recorded. In the present study, 646 patients of VL were given miltefosine. Majority of the study subjects (58\%) were male. Relapse occurred in 7\% during follow-up period. Main causes of death were VL–pulmonary tuberculosis coinfection, extreme diarrhea, and acute pancreatitis which were reported in 1.7\% subjects. Of 553 (85.6\%) patients completing full course of treatment, 463 (83.7\%) showed ADR with miltefosine during the study period. About 2.3\% were suffering severe ADR, 51\% from moderate, and the rest had mild ADR. The initial and final cure rate was 97.4\% and 85.6\%, respectively.},

We evaluated miltefosine in a phase IV trial of 977 patients in Bangladesh. At the six-month final follow up, 701 were cured. 24 showed initial treatment failure, and 95 showed treatment failure at 6 months, although 73 of the 95 showed treatment failure solely by the criterion of low hemoglobin values. One hundred twenty-one patients were not assessable. With the conservative assumption that all low hemoglobin values represented treatment failure, the final per protocol cure rate was 85\%. Of 13 severe adverse events, 6 led to treatment discontinuation and 7 resulted in deaths, but only 1 death (associated with diarrhea) could be attributed to drug. Nearly all non-serious adverse events were gastrointestinal: vomiting in 25\% of patients and diarrhea in 8\% of patients. Oral miltefosine is an attractive alternative to intramuscular antimony and intravenous amphotericin B for treatment of kala--azar in Bangladesh.},

  abstract  = {Many modern estimators require bootstrapping to calculate confidence intervals because either no analytic standard error is available or the distribution of the parameter of interest is nonsymmetric. It remains however unclear how to obtain valid bootstrap inference when dealing with multiple imputation to address missing data. We present 4 methods that are intuitively appealing, easy to implement, and combine bootstrap estimation with multiple imputation. We show that 3 of the 4 approaches yield valid inference, but that the performance of the methods varies with respect to the number of imputed data sets and the extent of missingness. Simulation studies reveal the behavior of our approaches in finite samples. A topical analysis from HIV treatment research, which determines the optimal timing of antiretroviral treatment initiation in young children, demonstrates the practical implications of the 4 methods in a sophisticated and realistic setting. This analysis suffers from missing data and uses theg‐formula for inference, a method for which no standard errors are available.},

  abstract   = {If individual participant data are available from multiple studies or clusters, then a prediction model can be externally validated multiple times. This allows the model’s discrimination and calibration performance to be examined across different settings. Random-effects meta-analysis can then be used to quantify overall (average) performance and heterogeneity in performance. This typically assumes a normal distribution of ‘true’ performance across studies. We conducted a simulation study to examine this normality assumption for various performance measures relating to a logistic regression prediction model. We simulated data across multiple studies with varying degrees of variability in baseline risk or predictor effects and then evaluated the shape of the between-study distribution in the C--statistic, calibration slope, calibration-in-the-large, and E/O statistic, and possible transformations thereof. We found that a normal between-study distribution was usually reasonable for the calibration slope and calibration-in-the-large; however, the distributions of the C--statistic and E/O were often skewed across studies, particularly in settings with large variability in the predictor effects. Normality was vastly improved when using the logit transformation for the C--statistic and the log transformation for E/O, and therefore we recommend these scales to be used for meta-analysis. An illustrated example is given using a random-effects meta-analysis of the performance of QRISK2 across 25 general practices.},

  abstract  = {Summary
               Amphotericin B (AB) deoxycholate is highly effective in antimony refractory cases for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Bihar. But the need for prolonged hospitalisation and frequent, occasionally serious, adverse events are its major drawbacks. Lipid formulations of AB are devoid of these problems, but very expensive. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of a commercial standardised amphotericin B emulsion, a product of AB formulated in lipid emulsion vehicle (ABLE) in the treatment of Indian VL. In this open label, non‐comparative study, 15 patients in each group were given three daily intravenous infusions each of 3, 4 or 5 mg/kg. All 45 patients (15 in each group) completed the treatment. The drug was tolerated well. Infusion reactions occurred in 5 (11\%) patients and vomiting in 2 (4.4\%). No nephrotoxicity or other organ toxicity was observed. At the end of treatment all patients of every group were clinically and parasitologically cured. However, during 6 months follow up, three patients from the 5 mg/kg group and one from the 4 mg/kg group tested positive for splenic aspirate. Thus 41 (91.1\%; 95\% CI 78–97) of 45 patients were cured with a total dose ranging between 9 and 15 mg/kg. There was no dose response linear correlation. In this preliminary study, AB formulated in a lipid emulsion vehicle was safe and effective for the treatment of VL in India.

               Le deoxycholate d’amphotéricine B (AB) est très efficace dans les cas réfractaires à l’antimoine pour le traitement de la leishmaniose viscérale (LV) à Bihar. Mais la nécessité d’une hospitalisation prolongée et fréquente, parfois grave et les effets indésirables sont des inconvénients majeurs. Les formulations lipidiques d’AB sont dépourvues de ces problèmes, mais sont très coûteuses. Nous avons évalué la sécurité et l’efficacité d’une émulsion commerciale standardisée d’AB, un produit à base d’AB formulé dans un véhicule àémulsion lipidique pour le traitement de la LV indienne. Dans cette étude ouverte, non comparative, 15 patients dans chaque groupe ont reçu trois perfusions intraveineuses quotidiennes contenant chacune 3, 4 ou 5 mg/kg. Tous les 45 patients (15 dans chaque groupe) ont complété le traitement. Le médicament était bien toléré. Des réactions liées à la perfusion ont eu lieu chez 5 (11\%) et des vomissements chez 2 (4,4\%) patients. Aucune néphrotoxicité ou des toxicités dans d’autres organes n’ont été observées. À la fin du traitement tous les patients de chaque groupe étaient cliniquement et parasitologiquement guéris. Cependant, 6 mois après, 3 patients du groupe ayant reçu 5 mg/kg et 1 du groupe à 4 mg/kg ont été testés positifs pour l’aspiration de la rate. Ainsi, 41 (91,1\%; IC95\%: 78–97) des 45 patients ont été guéris avec une dose totale comprise entre 9–15 mg/kg. Il n’y avait pas de corrélation dose‐réponse linéaire. Dans cette étude préliminaire, l’AB formulé dans un véhicule àémulsion lipidique s’est avérée sûre et efficace pour le traitement de la LV en Inde.

Pero la necesidad de hospitalización prolongada y efectos adversos frecuentes, y ocasionalmente serios, son los principales inconvenientes. Las formulaciones lipídicas de AB están exentas de estos problemas, pero son muy caras. Hemos evaluado la seguridad y la eficacia de una emulsión comercial estandarizada de Amfotericina B, un producto de ABformulado en un vehículo de emulsión lipídico (ABEL) para el tratamiento de la LV hindú. En este estudio abierto, no comparativo, se les dio a 15 pacientes de cada grupo tres infusiones intravenosas diarias, cada una de 3, 4 o 5 mg/kg. Los 45 pacientes (15 en cada grupo) completaron el tratamiento. El medicamento fue bien tolerado. En 5 (11\%) pacientes ocurrió una reacción a la infusión y 2 (4.4\%) tuvieron vómitos. No se observó nefrotoxicidad o toxicidad en otro órgano. Al final del tratamiento, todos los pacientes de cada grupo estaban clínica y parasitológicamente curados. Sin embargo, trás 6 meses, 3 pacientes del grupo de 5 mg/kg y 1 del grupo de 4 mg/kg dió positivo para el aspirado esplénico. Por lo tanto 41 (91.1\%; 95\% IC 78–97) de los 45 pacientes se curaron con rangos de dosis totales de 9–15 mg/kg. No se observó una correlación linear dosis‐respuesta. En este estudio preliminar, el AB formulado con un vehículo de emulsión lipídica fue seguro y efectivo para el tratamiento de LV en India.},

In this study, we used a higher-dose regimen of an indigenously manufactured liposomal amphotericin B (FUNGISOME; L-AmBL), which was intended to improve the efficacy in terms of long-lasting cure rate. Thirty men and thirty women between 12 and 60 years old with parasitologically confirmed visceral leishmaniasis were enrolled in two cohorts of 15 patients each. Subjects in cohort I were administered one dose (10 mg/kg body weight) of L-AmBL intravenously. After the safety at this dose was confirmed in cohort I, patients were recruited in cohort II. They received one infusion of an escalated dose (15 mg/kg body weight). The safety of these two doses was evaluated over a period of 30 days, and efficacy was assessed for initial cure at day 30 and definitive cure at 6 months. FUNGISOME was found to be safe, with an initial cure rate of 100\% at day 30 and a definitive cure rate of 93.3\% at the 6-month follow-up in both the cohorts.},

Simple ad-hoc fixes, like deletion or mean imputation, only work under highly restrictive conditions, which are often not met in practice. Multiple imputation replaces each missing value by multiple plausible values. The variability between these replacements reflects our ignorance of the true (but missing) value. Each of the completed data set is then analyzed by standard methods, and the results are pooled to obtain unbiased estimates with correct confidence intervals. Multiple imputation is a general approach that also inspires novel solutions to old problems by reformulating the task at hand as a missing-data problem. This is the second edition of a popular book on multiple imputation, focused on explaining the application of methods through detailed worked examples using the MICE package as developed by the author. This new edition incorporates the recent developments in this fast-moving field. This class-tested book avoids mathematical and technical details as much as possible: formulas are accompanied by verbal statements that explain the formula in accessible terms. The book sharpens the reader’s intuition on how to think about missing data, and provides all the tools needed to execute a well-grounded quantitative analysis in the presence of missing data},

                Multiple imputation by chained equations is a flexible and practical approach to handling missing data. We describe the principles of the method and show how to impute categorical and quantitative variables, including skewed variables. We give guidance on how to specify the imputation model and how many imputations are needed. We describe the practical analysis of multiply imputed data, including model building and model checking. We stress the limitations of the method and discuss the possible pitfalls. We illustrate the ideas using a data set in mental health, giving Stata code fragments.

  abstract     = {Background In Ethiopia, case fatality rates among subgroups of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients are high. A clinical prognostic score for death in VL patients could contribute to optimal management and reduction of these case fatality rates. We aimed to identify predictors of death from VL, and to develop and externally validate a clinical prognostic score for death in VL patients, in a high HIV co-infection burden area in Ethiopia. Methodology/Principal findings We conducted a retrospective cohort study in north west Ethiopia. Predictors with an adjusted likelihood ratio !1.5 or 0.67 were retained to calculate the predictor score. The derivation cohort consisted of 1686 VL patients treated at an upgraded health center and the external validation cohort consisted of 404 VL patients treated in hospital. There were 99 deaths in the derivation cohort and 53 deaths in the external validation cohort. The predictors of death were: age {$>$}40 years (score +1); HIV seropositive (score +1); HIV seronegative (score -1); hemoglobin 6.5 g/dl (score +1); bleeding (score +1); jaundice (score +1); edema (score +1); ascites (score +2) and tuberculosis (score +1). The total predictor score per patient ranged from -1 to +5. A score of -1, indicated a low risk of death (1.0\%), a score of 0 an intermediate risk of death (3.8\%) and a score of +1 to +5, a high risk of death (10.4–85.7\%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.83 (95\% confidence interval: 0.79–0.87) in derivation, and 0.78 (95\% confidence interval: 0.72–0.83) in external validation. Conclusions/Significance The overall performance of the score was good. The score can enable the early detection of VL cases at high risk of death, which can inform operational, clinical management},

Predictors               We identified predictors from systematic reviews, and prioritised for importance in an international survey.                                         Primary outcomes               Early-onset (delivery at {$<$}\,34 weeks’ gestation), late-onset (delivery at ≥\,34 weeks’ gestation) and any-onset pre-eclampsia.                                         Analysis                                We externally validated existing prediction models in UK cohorts and reported their performance in terms of discrimination and calibration. We developed and validated 12 new models based on clinical characteristics, clinical characteristics and biochemical markers, and clinical characteristics and ultrasound markers in the first and second trimesters. We summarised the data set-specific performance of each model using a random-effects meta-analysis. Discrimination was considered promising for                 C                 -statistics of ≥\,0.7, and calibration was considered good if the slope was near 1 and calibration-in-the-large was near 0. Heterogeneity was quantified using                 I                 2                 and τ                 2                 . A decision curve analysis was undertaken to determine the clinical utility (net benefit) of the models. We reported the unadjusted prognostic value of individual predictors for pre-eclampsia as odds ratios with 95\% confidence and prediction intervals.                                                        Results                                The International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications network comprised 78 studies (3,570,993 singleton pregnancies) identified from systematic reviews of tests to predict pre-eclampsia. Twenty-four of the 131 published prediction models could be validated in 11 UK cohorts. Summary                 C                 -statistics were between 0.6 and 0.7 for most models, and calibration was generally poor owing to large between-study heterogeneity, suggesting model overfitting. The clinical utility of the models varied between showing net harm to showing minimal or no net benefit. The average discrimination for IPPIC models ranged between 0.68 and 0.83. This was highest for the second-trimester clinical characteristics and biochemical markers model to predict early-onset pre-eclampsia, and lowest for the first-trimester clinical characteristics models to predict any pre-eclampsia. Calibration performance was heterogeneous across studies. Net benefit was observed for International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications first and second-trimester clinical characteristics and clinical characteristics and biochemical markers models predicting any pre-eclampsia, when validated in singleton nulliparous women managed in the UK NHS. History of hypertension, parity, smoking, mode of conception, placental growth factor and uterine artery pulsatility index had the strongest unadjusted associations with pre-eclampsia.                                                        Limitations               Variations in study population characteristics, type of predictors reported, too few events in some validation cohorts and the type of measurements contributed to heterogeneity in performance of the International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications models. Some published models were not validated because model predictors were unavailable in the individual participant data.                                         Conclusion               For models that could be validated, predictive performance was generally poor across data sets. Although the International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications models show good predictive performance on average, and in the singleton nulliparous population, heterogeneity in calibration performance is likely across settings.                                         Future work               Recalibration of model parameters within populations may improve calibration performance. Additional strong predictors need to be identified to improve model performance and consistency. Validation, including examination of calibration heterogeneity, is required for the models we could not validate.

  abstract     = {SUMMARY               To date, most Leishmania and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection cases reported to WHO come from Southern Europe. Up to the year 2001, nearly 2,000 cases of coinfection were identified, of which 90\% were from Spain, Italy, France, and Portugal. However, these figures are misleading because they do not account for the large proportion of cases in many African and Asian countries that are missed due to a lack of diagnostic facilities and poor reporting systems. Most cases of coinfection in the Americas are reported in Brazil, where the incidence of leishmaniasis has spread in recent years due to overlap with major areas of HIV transmission. In some areas of Africa, the number of coinfection cases has increased dramatically due to social phenomena such as mass migration and wars. In northwest Ethiopia, up to 30\% of all visceral leishmaniasis patients are also infected with HIV. In Asia, coinfections are increasingly being reported in India, which also has the highest global burden of leishmaniasis and a high rate of resistance to antimonial drugs. Based on the previous experience of 20 years of coinfection in Europe, this review focuses on the management of Leishmania-HIV-coinfected patients in low-income countries where leishmaniasis is endemic.},

Systematic research by geographical regions has shown that a universal treatment is far from today's reality.           ,              SUMMARY             Research in visceral leishmaniasis in the last decade has been focused on how better to use the existing medicines as monotherapy or in combination. Systematic research by geographical regions has shown that a universal treatment is far from today's reality. Substantial progress has been made in the elimination of kala-azar in South Asia, with a clear strategy on first- and second-line therapy options of single dose liposomal amphotericin B and a combination of paromomycin and miltefosine, respectively, among other interventions. In Eastern Africa, sodium stibogluconate (SSG) and paromomycin in combination offer an advantage compared to the previous SSG monotherapy, although not exempted of limitations, as this therapy requires 17 days of painful double injections and bears the risk of SSG-related cardiotoxicity. In this region, attempts to improve the combination therapy have been unsuccessful. However, pharmacokinetic studies have led to a better understanding of underlying mechanisms, like the underexposure of children to miltefosine treatment, and an improved regimen using an allometric dosage. Given this global scenario of progress and pitfalls, we here review what steps need to be taken with existing medicines and highlight the urgent need for oral drugs. Furthermore, it should be noted that six candidates belonging to five new chemical classes are reaching phase I, ensuring an optimistic near future.},

Subjects (n = 5573) were original and offspring subjects in the Framingham Heart Study, aged 30 to 74 years, and initially free of cardiovascular disease. Equations to predict risk for the following were developed: myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease (CHD), death from CHD, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and death from cardiovascular disease. The equations demonstrated the potential importance of controlling multiple risk factors (blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, glucose intolerance, and left ventricular hypertrophy) as opposed to focusing on one single risk factor. The parametric model used was seen to have several advantages over existing standard regression models. Unlike logistic regression, it can provide predictions for different lengths of time, and probabilities can be expressed in a more straightforward way than the Cox proportional hazards model.},

  abstract     = {Background:               Variable selection is an important issue when developing prognostic models. Missing data occur frequently in clinical research. Multiple imputation is increasingly used to address the presence of missing data in clinical research. The effect of different variable selection strategies with multiply imputed data on the external performance of derived prognostic models has not been well examined.                                         Methods and Results:               We used backward variable selection with 9 different ways to handle multiply imputed data in a derivation sample to develop logistic regression models for predicting death within 1 year of hospitalization with an acute myocardial infarction. We assessed the prognostic accuracy of each derived model in a temporally distinct validation sample. The derivation and validation samples consisted of 11\,524 patients hospitalized between 1999 and 2001 and 7889 patients hospitalized between 2004 and 2005, respectively. We considered 41 candidate predictor variables. Missing data occurred frequently, with only 13\% of patients in the derivation sample and 31\% of patients in the validation sample having complete data. Regardless of the significance level for variable selection, the prognostic model developed using only the complete cases in the derivation sample had substantially worse performance in the validation sample than did the models for which variables were selected using the multiply imputed versions of the derivation sample. The other 8 approaches to handling multiply imputed data resulted in prognostic models with performance similar to one another.                                         Conclusions:               Ignoring missing data and using only subjects with complete data can result in the derivation of prognostic models with poor performance. Multiple imputation should be used to account for missing data when developing prognostic models.},

  abstract     = {Objectives: We conducted a meta-analysis to summarize diagnostic properties of risk factors and clinical prediction rules for diagnosing infective endocarditis (IE) in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB). Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Database from inception to 6 January 2016 to identify studies evaluating risk factors and clinical prediction rules for IE in SAB patients. Pooled estimates of diagnostic properties for main risk factors were calculated using a bivariate random effects model. Results: Of 962 articles identified, 30 studies were included. These involved 16 538 SAB patients including 1572 IE cases. Risk factors with positive likelihood ratio (PLR) greater than 5 included embolic events (PLR 12.7, 95\% CI 9.2e17.7), pacemakers (PLR 9.7, 95\% CI 3.7e21.2), history of previous IE (PLR 8.2, 95\% CI 3.1e22.0), prosthetic valves (PLR 5.7, 95\% CI 3.2e9.5), and intravenous drug use (PLR 5.2, 95\% CI 3.8e6.9). The only clinical factor with negative likelihood ratio (NLR) less than 0.5 was documented clearance of bacteraemia within 72 hours (NLR range 0.32e0.35). Of the nine published clinical prediction rules for ruling out IE, five had an NLR below 0.1. Conclusions: SAB patients with high-risk features (embolic events, pacemakers, prosthetic valves, previous IE, or intravenous drug use) should undergo a trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) for IE. Clinical prediction rules show promise in safely ruling out endocarditis, but require validation in future studies. A.D.

  abstract     = {Background: In the current context of high fatality rates associated with American visceral leishmaniasis (VL), the appropriate use of prognostic factors to identify patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes represents a potential tool for clinical practice. This systematic review brings together information reported in studies conducted in Latin America, on the potential predictors of adverse prognosis (continued evolution of the initial clinical conditions of the patient despite the implementation of treatment, independent of the occurrence of death) and death from VL. The limitations of the existing knowledge, the advances achieved and the approaches to be used in future research are presented. Methods/Principal Findings: The full texts of 14 studies conforming to the inclusion criteria were analyzed and their methodological quality examined by means of a tool developed in the light of current research tools. Information regarding prognostic variables was synthesized using meta-analysis. Variables were grouped according to the strength of evidence considering summary measures, patterns and heterogeneity of effect-sizes, and the results of multivariate analyses. The strongest predictors identified in this review were jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age ,5 and age .40–50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnoea and bacterial infections. Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with unfavorable outcomes. The main limitation identified was the absence of validation procedures for the few prognostic models developed so far. Conclusions/Significance: Integration of the results from different investigations conducted over the last 10 years enabled the identification of consistent prognostic variables that could be useful in recognizing and handling VL patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes. The development of externally validated prognostic models must be prioritized in future investigations.},

Leishmania DNA was detected in 10 of 25 patients with microscopically confirmed visceral leishmaniasis and in none of those without this disease. Following treatment with liposomal amphotericin B, a clinical response was observed in 9 of 10 patients, in association with significantly decreased parasite loads. Seven patients relapsed clinically a median of 110 days after the end of treatment, in association with substantial increases in Leishmania DNA levels. Leishmania DNA levels correlated with the clinical course of visceral leishmaniasis, and their measurement at diagnosis and during and after treatment seems to be useful in the clinical management of HIV-infected patients with this disease.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: We investigated the reporting and methods of prediction studies, focusing on aims, designs, participant selection, outcomes, predictors, statistical power, statistical methods, and predictive performance measures. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a full hand search to identify all prediction studies published in 2008 in six high impact general medical journals. We developed a comprehensive item list to systematically score conduct and reporting of the studies, based on recent recommendations for prediction research. Two reviewers independently scored the studies. We retrieved 71 papers for full text review: 51 were predictor finding studies, 14 were prediction model development studies, three addressed an external validation of a previously developed model, and three reported on a model's impact on participant outcome. Study design was unclear in 15\% of studies, and a prospective cohort was used in most studies (60\%). Descriptions of the participants and definitions of predictor and outcome were generally good. Despite many recommendations against doing so, continuous predictors were often dichotomized (32\% of studies). The number of events per predictor as a measure of statistical power could not be determined in 67\% of the studies; of the remainder, 53\% had fewer than the commonly recommended value of ten events per predictor. Methods for a priori selection of candidate predictors were described in most studies (68\%). A substantial number of studies relied on a p-value cut-off of p{$<$}0.05 to select predictors in the multivariable analyses (29\%). Predictive model performance measures, i.e., calibration and discrimination, were reported in 12\% and 27\% of studies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of prediction studies in high impact journals do not follow current methodological recommendations, limiting their reliability and applicability.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: A proportion of all immunocompetent patients treated for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) are known to relapse; however, the risk factors for relapse are not well understood. With the support of the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute (RMRI), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) implemented a program in Bihar, India, using intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome) as a first-line treatment for VL. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for VL relapse by examining the characteristics of immunocompetent patients who relapsed following this regimen. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This is an observational retrospective cohort study of all VL patients treated by the MSF program from July 2007 to August 2012. Intravenous Ambisome was administered to 8749 patients with VL in four doses of 5 mg/kg (for a total dose of 20 mg/kg) over 4-10 days, depending on the severity of disease. Out of 8588 patients not known to be HIV-positive, 8537 (99.4\%) were discharged as initial cures, 24 (0.3\%) defaulted, and 27 (0.3\%) died during or immediately after treatment. In total, 1.4\% (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}119) of the initial cured patients re-attended the programme with parasitologically confirmed VL relapse, with a median time to relapse of 10.1 months. Male sex, age {$<$}5 years and ≥45 years, a decrease in spleen size at time of discharge of ≤0.5 cm/day, and a shorter duration of symptoms prior to seeking treatment were significantly associated with relapse. Spleen size at admission, hemoglobin level, nutritional status, and previous history of relapse were not associated with relapse. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest cohort of VL patients treated with Ambisome worldwide. The risk factors for relapse included male sex, age {$<$}5 and ≥45 years, a smaller decrease in splenomegaly at discharge, and a shorter duration of symptoms prior to seeking treatment. The majority of relapses in this cohort occurred 6-12 months following treatment, suggesting that a 1-year follow-up is appropriate in future studies.},

The variables presenting a good discriminant power were: heart rate, white blood cells count, blood lymphocytes count, platelets count and glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase. The discriminant score for the risk of infectious complications in each case was estimated by means of the defined discriminant function, resulting in 75.93\% of correct classification in each group, with 80.60\% of correct prediction of the risk.

  abstract     = {Background: Before considering whether to use a multivariable (diagnostic or prognostic) prediction model, it is essential that its performance be evaluated in data that were not used to develop the model (referred to as external validation). We critically appraised the methodological conduct and reporting of external validation studies of multivariable prediction models. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of articles describing some form of external validation of one or more multivariable prediction models indexed in PubMed core clinical journals published in 2010. Study data were extracted in duplicate on design, sample size, handling of missing data, reference to the original study developing the prediction models and predictive performance measures. Results: 11,826 articles were identified and 78 were included for full review, which described the evaluation of 120 prediction models. in participant data that were not used to develop the model. Thirty-three articles described both the development of a prediction model and an evaluation of its performance on a separate dataset, and 45 articles described only the evaluation of an existing published prediction model on another dataset. Fifty-seven percent of the prediction models were presented and evaluated as simplified scoring systems. Sixteen percent of articles failed to report the number of outcome events in the validation datasets. Fifty-four percent of studies made no explicit mention of missing data. Sixty-seven percent did not report evaluating model calibration whilst most studies evaluated model discrimination. It was often unclear whether the reported performance measures were for the full regression model or for the simplified models. Conclusions: The vast majority of studies describing some form of external validation of a multivariable prediction model were poorly reported with key details frequently not presented. The validation studies were characterised by poor design, inappropriate handling and acknowledgement of missing data and one of the most key performance measures of prediction models i.e. calibration often omitted from the publication. It may therefore not be surprising that an overwhelming majority of developed prediction models are not used in practice, when there is a dearth of well-conducted and clearly reported (external validation) studies describing their performance on independent participant data.},

However, despite its importance, very little is known about the sample size requirements for conducting an external validation. Using a large real data set and resampling methods, we investigate the impact of sample size on the performance of six published prognostic models. Focussing on unbiased and precise estimation of performance measures (e.g.\ the c-index, D statistic and calibration), we provide guidance on sample size for investigators designing an external validation study. Our study suggests that externally validating a prognostic model requires a minimum of 100 events and ideally 200 (or more) events.},

Anticipating this shrinkage leads to Stein‐type predictors which, under certain assumptions, give a uniformly lower prediction mean squared error than least squares. Shrinkage can be particularly marked when stepwise fitting is used: the shrinkage is then closer to that expected of the full regression rather than of the subset regression actually fitted. Preshrunk predictors for selected subsets are proposed and tested on a number of practical examples. Both multiple and binary (logistic) regression models are considered.},

  abstract    = {Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), may present from asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infection to a devastating and fatal disease and the syndrome frequently encompasses fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly,and pancytopenia. The risk factors for death and the pathogenesis of the disturbances are poorly recognized. The aim of this work is to investigate the clinical aspects, the markers ofinflammation and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in VL patients and to develop a prognostic score system model for death. Patients and Methods:An open hospital based cohort of 883 was conductedfrom September 2005 to August 2008. A sub group of 314 infants was described in detail. Two case-cohort studies were designed to investigate the bleeding disorders and the immune response. Markers for disseminated intravascular coagulation were evaluated in 185 patients. Serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers of unspecific inflammatory response were measured in 134 patients of the inflammation case-control study. Results:Most patients (92.5\%) were successfully treated but 66 (7.5\%) patients died. Mortality rate was 7.5\%. Infants, oldest patients and HIV co-infected patients had the most severe disease with a higher mortality. Malnutrition was more frequent in adults and not associated to bleeding events or death but recent weight loss was related to death. The signs and symptoms associated to death were jaundice, vomiting, diarrhea, edema, lethargy, anorexia, cough, bacterial infections and bleeding events. Risk of death was higher in patients with thrombocytotopenia, leucopenia, anemia, low glomerular filtration rate e increased liver enzymes. High levels of D-dimer were seen in 183 (98.9\%) patients and high levels of FPA were seen in 67(63.8\%) patients. FDP latex agglutination was positive in 121(65.7\%) cases. Levels of D-dimer and positivity of FDP latex agglutination were higher in patients with bleeding disorders. Elevated levels of ultra sensitive C-reactive protein (CRPhigh)were seen in 85 (68.6\%) patients were and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was over 10 mm (µ=61,1mm) in 154 (90.6\%). The CRPhigh was correlated to digestive bleeding and bacterialinfections. Cytokines levels were associated with jaundice, respiratory distress, vomiting, edema and diarrhea. Levels of IL-6, CXCL-8 and IFN-were higher among deceased patients. Patients withbleeding had higher levels of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and IFN-.Cytokines levels were not associated with bacterial infections without hemorrhages. A prognostic score system model for death prediction is presented. Conclusions:VL was especially severe in infants and adults. Most VL patients present coagulation activation. Bacterial infections are co-factors that exacerbate inflammation and bursts hemorrhages. High levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-1, IL-10 and IFN-are correlated to anemia, neutropenia, respiratory distress, hepatitis, renal and intestinal injury, diarrhea and vomits. The prognostic model may be helpful in identifying patients at high risk of death.}

  abstract     = {Introduction: Early identification of patients at higher risk of progressing to severe disease and death is crucial for implementing therapeutic and preventive measures; this could reduce the morbidity and mortality from kala-azar. We describe a score set composed of four scales in addition to software for quick assessment of the probability of death from kala-azar at the point of care. Methods: Data from 883 patients diagnosed between September 2005 and August 2008 were used to derive the score set, and data from 1,031 patients diagnosed between September 2008 and November 2013 were used to validate the models. Stepwise logistic regression analyses were used to derive the optimal multivariate prediction models. Model performance was assessed by its discriminatory accuracy. A computational specialist system (Kala-Cal®) was developed to speed up the calculation of the probability of death based on clinical scores. Results: The clinical prediction score showed high discrimination (area under the curve [AUC] 0.90) for distinguishing death from survival for children ≤2 years old. Performance improved after adding laboratory variables (AUC 0.93). The clinical score showed equivalent discrimination (AUC 0.89) for older children and adults, which also improved after including laboratory data (AUC 0.92). The score set also showed a high, although lower, discrimination when applied to the validation cohort. Conclusions: This score set and Kala-Cal® software may help identify individuals with the greatest probability of death. The associated software may speed up the calculation of the probability of death based on clinical scores and assist physicians in decision-making.},

Methods: Seventy-six deceased inpatients and 320 successfully treated inpatients with VL were studied in a case control study. Results: Bacterial infection and bleeding were mutually exclusive events leading to death. Five risk factors were unique for death by bacterial infection (malnutrition, pulmonary rales, severe anemia, severe absolute neutropenia and higher neutrophil count), while another six were unique for death by bleeding (jaundice, severe relative neutropenia, severe thrombocytopenia, liver injury, kidney failure, higher bone marrow parasite load). Bacterial infection, bleeding, severe anemia, diarrhea, dyspnea, edema, jaundice and bone marrow parasite load were the main syndromes of visceral leishmaniasis among successfully treated patients. Conclusions: The data support the idea that bacterial infections are due to immune paralysis. Broad organ and system involvement is plausibly due to the high production of proinflammatory cytokines, whose actions fit well with visceral leishmaniasis. The syndromes and causative mediators are typical of a slowly developing systemic inflammatory response syndrome.},

Although antiretroviral therapy has changed the clinical course of HIV infection and its associated illnesses, the prevention of VL relapses remains a challenge for the care of HIV and Leishmania co-infected patients. This work is a systematic review of previous studies that have described predictors of VL relapse in HIV-infected patients. Review Methods: We searched the electronic databases of MEDLINE, LILACS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Studies were selected if they included HIV-infected individuals with a VL diagnosis and patient follow-up after the leishmaniasis treatment with an analysis of the clearly defined outcome of prediction of relapse. Results: Eighteen out 178 studies satisfied the specified inclusion criteria. Most patients were males between 30 and 40 years of age, and HIV transmission was primarily via intravenous drug use. Previous VL episodes were identified as risk factors for relapse in 3 studies. Two studies found that baseline CD4+ T cell count above 100 cells/mL was associated with a decreased relapse rate. The observation of an increase in CD4+ T cells at patient follow-up was associated with protection from relapse in 5 of 7 studies. Meta-analysis of all studies assessing secondary prophylaxis showed significant reduction of VL relapse rate following prophylaxis. None of the five observational studies evaluating the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy use found a reduction in the risk of VL relapse upon patient follow-up.

  abstract     = {Background: In Brazil, case-fatality rates attributable to visceral leishmaniasis (VL) are high and knowledge of the risk factors associated with death may help reduce mortality. The aim of this study was to construct and validate a scoring system for prognosis of death from VL by using all cases reported in Brazil from 2007 to 2011. Methodology: In this historical cohort study, 18,501 VL cases were analyzed; of these, 17,345 cases were cured and 1,156 cases caused death. The database was divided into two series: primary (two-thirds of cases), to develop the model score, and secondary (one-third of cases), to validate the scoring system. Multivariate logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with death from VL, and these were included in the scoring system. Principal Findings: The factors associated with death from VL were: bleeding (score 3); splenomegaly (score 1); edema (score 1); weakness (score 1); jaundice (score 1); Leishmania–HIV co-infection (score 1); bacterial infection (score 1); and age (\#0.5 years [score 5]; .0.5 and \#1 [score 2]; .19 and \#50 [score 2]; .50 and ,65 [score 3]; \$65 [score 5]). It was observed that patients with a score of 4 had a probability of death of approximately 4.5\% and had a worse prognosis. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of this score were 89.4, 51.2, and 53.5, respectively. Conclusions/Significance: The scoring system based on risk factors for death showed good performance in identifying patients with signs of severity at the time of clinical suspicion of VL and can contribute to improving the surveillance system for reducing case fatalities. The classification of patients according to their prognosis for death may assist decision-making regarding the transfer of the patients to hospitals more capable of handling their condition, admission to the intensive care unit, and adequate support and specific treatment.},

  abstract     = {Abstract             The Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO) data platform was launched in 2016 with the aim of harmonizing individual participant data (IPD) from clinical trials on infectious diseases, with a specific focus on neglected tropical diseases, including visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The VL data platform hosted by IDDO was developed in collaboration with researchers at the frontline of disease combat. This platform currently hosts IPD from more than 50 studies on VL and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). The platform remains a controlled open-access repository to the scientific community and is currently facilitating collaborative IPD meta-analyses addressing research questions regarding drug safety and efficacy. Further open-access resources maintained by IDDO include clinical case report forms (CRFs) for VL, and VL-human immunodeficiency trials, a comprehensive inventory of all published VL clinical trials (1980–to date) and PKDL trials (1973–-to date), and these are publicly available as downloadable resources to the research community. These open-access resources developed in collaboration with the scientific community can help in identifying research gaps, and facilitate the generation of new evidence, and the CRFs can help to harmonize data collection for future trials. In this study, we highlight some of the ongoing and past research activities undertaken using these open-access resources (such as predictors of relapse and the development of a clinical scoring system for detecting relapse) and how these can support generating evidence to complement the ongoing activities in the Indian subcontinent and East Africa to reach the elimination targets.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: There is significant variation in Amphotericin B (AMB) efficacy and relapses in antimony unresponsive visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases over a period of time (10-15 years). Keeping in mind the above mentioned view this study was undertaken with an objective to assess the magnitude of cure and relapse rates of AMB in the treatment of antimony unresponsive VL cases. METHODS: In a controlled, randomized nonblinded clinical trial, we evaluated the cure and relapse rate of Amphotericin B deoxycholate as compared to pentamidine. A total of 82 sodium stibogluconate (SSG) unresponsive and parasitologically confirmed VL cases were included in this study and randomized into two groups, test (Amphotericin B) and control (Pentamidine). Both the groups were treated with recommended dosages (as per World Health Organization guidelines) of respective medicines. All the patients were followed up on 1st, 2nd, and 6th month after end of treatment. RESULTS: Apparent cure rate in the Amphotericin B group was found to be 95\% (39/41) compared with 83\% (34/41) in the Pentamidine group, which shows significant statistical difference (p = 0.05). The ultimate cure rate was found 92\% (38/41) in the Amphotericin B group compared to 73\% (30/41) in the Pentamidine group, which shows a significant statistical difference (Yates corrected chi-square = 4.42, p = 0.04). Similarly, significant statistical difference was observed in the relapse rate of the Amphotericin group compared to the Pentamidine group (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: AMB may still be the drug of choice in the management of resistant VL cases in Bihar, India. This is due to its consistent apparent cure rate (95\%), low relapse rate (2.5\%), and cost effectiveness compared with other available antileishmanial drugs. It is a safe drug even in case of pregnancy. Efforts should be taken to form a future strategy so that this drug and coming newer drugs do not meet a similar fate as has happened to SSG and pentamidine over a span of 10-15 years.},

Methods: We randomly selected 180 cases (death caused by VL) and 180 controls (cured) from Belo Horizonte’s hospitals in Brazil, according to data found in the patients’ medical records. Five models of multivariate logistic regression were performed following the chronological order of the variables between the onset of the symptoms and evolution of the VL cases. Results: Considering the multivariate models and the stages of clinical evolution of VL, the prognostic factors associated with death are: age {$>$}60 y, minor hemorrhagic phenomena, increased abdominal volume, jaundice, dyspnea, malnutrition, TB, billirubin {$>$}2 mg/dL, Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) {$>$}100 U/L, leukocytes {$>$}7000/mm3, hemoglobin {$<$}7 g/dL, platelets {$<$}50 000/mm3 and infection without defined focus and bleeding.

  abstract     = {Background: In Brazil, lethality from visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is high and few studies have addressed prognostic factors. This historical cohort study was designed to investigate the prognostic factors for death from VL in Belo Horizonte (Brazil). Methodology: The analysis was based on data of the Reportable Disease Information System-SINAN (Brazilian Ministry of Health) relating to the clinical manifestations of the disease. During the study period (2002–2009), the SINAN changed platform from a Windows to a Net-version that differed with respect to some of the parameters collected. Multivariate logistic regression models were performed to identify variables associated with death from VL, and these were included in prognostic score. Principal Findings: Model 1 (period 2002–2009; 111 deaths from VL and 777 cured patients) included the variables present in both SINAN versions, whereas Model 2 (period 2007–2009; 49 deaths from VL and 327 cured patients) included variables common to both SINAN versions plus the additional variables included in the Net version. In Model 1, the variables significantly associated with a greater risk of death from VL were weakness (OR 2.9; 95\%CI 1.3–6.4), Leishmania-HIV coinfection (OR 2.4; 95\%CI 1.2–4.8) and age \$60 years (OR 2.5; 95\%CI 1.5–4.3). In Model 2, the variables were bleeding (OR 3.5; 95\%CI 1.2–10.3), other associated infections (OR 3.2; 95\%CI 1.3–7.8), jaundice (OR 10.1; 95\%CI 3.7–27.2) and age \$60 years (OR 3.1; 95\%CI 1.4–7.1). The prognosis score was developed using the variables associated with death from VL of the latest version of the SINAN (Model 2). The predictive performance of which was evaluated by sensitivity (71.4\%), specificity (73.7\%), positive and negative predictive values (28.9\% and 94.5\%) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (75.6\%). Conclusions: Knowledge regarding the factors associated with death from VL may improve clinical management of patients and contribute to lower mortality.},

  abstract     = {Abstract                            Background               Having an appropriate sample size is important when developing a clinical prediction model. We aimed to review how sample size is considered in studies developing a prediction model for a binary outcome.                                         Methods               We searched PubMed for studies published between 01/07/2020 and 30/07/2020 and reviewed the sample size calculations used to develop the prediction models. Using the available information, we calculated the minimum sample size that would be needed to estimate overall risk and minimise overfitting in each study and summarised the difference between the calculated and used sample size.                                         Results               A total of 119 studies were included, of which nine studies provided sample size justification (8\%). The recommended minimum sample size could be calculated for 94 studies: 73\% (95\% CI: 63–82\%) used sample sizes lower than required to estimate overall risk and minimise overfitting including 26\% studies that used sample sizes lower than required to estimate overall risk only. A similar number of studies did not meet the ≥\,10EPV criteria (75\%, 95\% CI: 66–84\%). The median deficit of the number of events used to develop a model was 75 [IQR: 234 lower to 7 higher]) which reduced to 63 if the total available data (before any data splitting) was used [IQR:225 lower to 7 higher]. Studies that met the minimum required sample size had a median c-statistic of 0.84 (IQR:0.80 to 0.9) and studies where the minimum sample size was not met had a median c-statistic of 0.83 (IQR: 0.75 to 0.9). Studies that met the ≥\,10 EPP criteria had a median c-statistic of 0.80 (IQR: 0.73 to 0.84).                                         Conclusions               Prediction models are often developed with no sample size calculation, as a consequence many are too small to precisely estimate the overall risk. We encourage researchers to justify, perform and report sample size calculations when developing a prediction model.},

  abstract     = {Background: Classification systems for orthopaedic infection include patient health status, but there is no consensus about which comorbidities affect prognosis. Modifiable factors including substance use, glycaemic control, malnutrition and obesity may predict post-operative recovery from infection. Aim: This systematic review aimed (1) to critically appraise clinical prediction models for individual prognosis following surgical treatment for orthopaedic infection where an implant is not retained; (2) to understand the usefulness of modifiable prognostic factors for predicting treatment success. Methods: EMBASE and MEDLINE databases were searched for clinical prediction and prognostic studies in adults with orthopaedic infections. Infection recurrence or re-infection after at least 6 months was the primary outcome. The estimated odds ratios for the primary outcome in participants with modifiable prognostic factors were extracted and the direction of the effect reported. Results: Thirty-five retrospective prognostic cohort studies of 92 693 patients were included, of which two reported clinical prediction models. No studies were at low risk of bias, and no externally validated prediction models were identified. Most focused on prosthetic joint infection. A positive association was reported between body mass index and infection recurrence in 19 of 22 studies, similarly in 8 of 14 studies reporting smoking history and 3 of 4 studies reporting alcohol intake. Glycaemic control and malnutrition were rarely considered. Conclusion: Modifiable aspects of patient health appear to predict outcomes after surgery for orthopaedic infection. There is a need to understand which factors may have a causal effect. Development and validation of clinical prediction models that include participant health status will facilitate treatment decisions for orthopaedic infections.},

  abstract     = {Background               Unprovoked first venous thromboembolism (VTE) is defined as VTE in the absence of a temporary provoking factor such as surgery, immobility and other temporary factors. Recurrent VTE in unprovoked patients is highly prevalent, but easily preventable with oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy. The unprovoked population is highly heterogeneous in terms of risk of recurrent VTE.                                         Objectives               The first aim of the project is to review existing prognostic models which stratify individuals by their recurrence risk, therefore potentially allowing tailored treatment strategies. The second aim is to enhance the existing research in this field, by developing and externally validating a new prognostic model for individual risk prediction, using a pooled database containing individual patient data (IPD) from several studies. The final aim is to assess the economic cost-effectiveness of the proposed prognostic model if it is used as a decision rule for resuming OAC therapy, compared with current standard treatment strategies.                                         Methods               Standard systematic review methodology was used to identify relevant prognostic model development, validation and cost-effectiveness studies. Bibliographic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library) were searched using terms relating to the clinical area and prognosis. Reviewing was undertaken by two reviewers independently using pre-defined criteria. Included full-text articles were data extracted and quality assessed. Critical appraisal of included full texts was undertaken and comparisons made of model performance. A prognostic model was developed using IPD from the pooled database of seven trials. A novel internal–external cross-validation (IECV) approach was used to develop and validate a prognostic model, with external validation undertaken in each of the trials iteratively. Given good performance in the IECV approach, a final model was developed using all trials data. A Markov patient-level simulation was used to consider the economic cost-effectiveness of using a decision rule (based on the prognostic model) to decide on resumption of OAC therapy (or not).                                         Results                                Three full-text articles were identified by the systematic review. Critical appraisal identified methodological and applicability issues; in particular, all three existing models did not have external validation. To address this, new prognostic models were sought with external validation. Two potential models were considered: one for use at cessation of therapy (pre D-dimer), and one for use after cessation of therapy (post D-dimer). Model performance measured in the external validation trials showed strong calibration performance for both models. The post D-dimer model performed substantially better in terms of discrimination (                 c                 \,=\,0.69), better separating high- and low-risk patients. The economic evaluation identified that a decision rule based on the final post D-dimer model may be cost-effective for patients with predicted risk of recurrence of over 8\% annually; this suggests continued therapy for patients with predicted risks ≥\,8\% and cessation of therapy otherwise.                                                        Conclusions               The post D-dimer model performed strongly and could be useful to predict individuals’ risk of recurrence at any time up to 2–3 years, thereby aiding patient counselling and treatment decisions. A decision rule using this model may be cost-effective for informing clinical judgement and patient opinion in treatment decisions. Further research may investigate new predictors to enhance model performance and aim to further externally validate to confirm performance in new, non-trial populations. Finally, it is essential that further research is conducted to develop a model predicting bleeding risk on therapy, to manage the balance between the risks of recurrence and bleeding.

  abstract     = {Objectives. To perform a temporal validation of a predictive model for death in children with visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Methods. A temporal validation of a children-exclusive predictive model of death due to VL (Sampaio et al. 2010 model), using a retrospective cohort, hereby called validation cohort. The validation cohort convenience sample was made of 156 patients less than 15 years old hospitalized between 2008 and 2018 with VL. Patients included in the Sampaio et al. 2010 study are here denominated derivation cohort, which was composed of 546 patients hospitalized in the same hospital setting in the period from 1996 to 2006. The calibration and discriminative capacity of the model to predict death by VL in the validation cohort were then assessed through the procedure of logistic recalibration that readjusted its coefficients. The calibration of the updated model was tested using Hosmer–Lemeshow test and Spiegelhalter test. A ROC curve was built and the value of the area under this curve represented the model’s discrimination. Results. The validation cohort found a lethality of 6.4\%. The Sampaio et al. 2010 model demonstrated inadequate calibration in the validation cohort (Spiegelhalter test:                                                   p                   =                   0.007                                               ). It also presented unsatisfactory discriminative capacity, evaluated by the area under the ROC curve\,=\,0.618. After the coefficient readjustment, the model showed adequate calibration (Spiegelhalter test,                                                   p                   =                   0.988                                               ) and better discrimination, becoming satisfactory (AUROC\,=\,0.762). The score developed by Sampaio et al. 2010 attributed 1 point to the variables dyspnea, associated infections, and neutrophil count {$<$}500/mm3; 2 points to jaundice and mucosal bleeding; and 3 points to platelet count {$<$}50,000/mm3. In the recalibrated model, each one of the variables had a scoring of 1 point for each. Conclusion. The temporally validated model, after coefficient readjustment, presented adequate calibration and discrimination to predict death in children hospitalized with VL.},

  abstract = {It is important to distinguish prediction and classification. In many decisionmaking contexts, classification represents a premature decision, because classification combines prediction and decision making and usurps the decision maker in specifying costs of wrong decisions. The classification rule must be reformulated if costs/utilities or sampling criteria change. Predictions are separate from decisions and can be used by any decision maker. Classification is best used with non-stochastic/deterministic outcomes that occur in say 0.3 - 0.7 of the observations, and not when the simplest classifer (always outputting “positive” or always outputting “negative”) is highly accurate or when two individuals with identical inputs can easily have different outcomes. For these situations, modeling tendencies (i.e., probabilities) is key. Classification should be used when outcomes are distinct and predictors are strong enough to provide, for all subjects, a probability near 1.0 for one of the outcomes.}

  abstract     = {Purpose: Existing expert systems have not improved the diagnostic accuracy of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The aim of this systematic literature review was to review and summarize state-of-the-art prediction models detecting or predicting VAP from exhaled breath, patient reports and demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods: Both diagnostic and prognostic prediction models were searched from a representative list of multidisciplinary databases. An extensive list of validated search terms was added to the search to cover papers failing to mention predictive research in their title or abstract. Two authors independently selected studies, while three authors extracted data using predefined criteria and data extraction forms. The Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was used to assess both the risk of bias and the applicability of the prediction modelling studies. Technology readiness was also assessed. Results: Out of 2052 identified studies, 20 were included. Fourteen (70\%) studies reported the predictive performance of diagnostic models to detect VAP from exhaled human breath with a high degree of sensitivity and a moderate specificity. In addition, the majority of them were validated on a realistic dataset. The rest of the studies reported the predictive performance of diagnostic and prognostic prediction models to detect VAP from unstructured narratives [2 (10\%)] as well as baseline demographics and clinical characteristics [4 (20\%)]. All studies, however, had either a high or unclear risk of bias without significant improvements in applicability. Conclusions: The development and deployment of prediction modelling studies are limited in VAP and related outcomes. More computational, translational, and clinical research is needed to bring these tools from the bench to the bedside.},

  abstract     = {Background               Snakebite is a neglected problem with a high mortality in India. There are no simple clinical prognostic tools which can predict mortality in viper envenomings. We aimed to develop and validate a mortality-risk prediction score for patients of viper envenoming from Southern India.                                         Methods               We used clinical predictors from a prospective cohort of 248 patients with syndromic diagnosis of viper envenoming and had a positive 20-minute whole blood clotting test (WBCT 20) from a tertiary-care hospital in Puducherry, India. We applied multivariable logistic regression with backward elimination approach. External validation of this score was done among 140 patients from the same centre and its performance was assessed with concordance statistic and calibration plots.                                         Findings               The final model termed VENOMS from the term “Viper ENvenOming Mortality Score included 7 admission clinical parameters (recorded in the first 48 hours after bite): presence of overt bleeding manifestations, presence of capillary leak syndrome, haemoglobin {$<$}10 g/dL, bite to antivenom administration time {$>$} 6.5 h, systolic blood pressure {$<$} 100 mm Hg, urine output {$<$}20 mL/h in 24 h and female gender. The lowest possible VENOMS score of 0 predicted an in-hospital mortality risk of 0.06\% while highest score of 12 predicted a mortality of 99.1\%. The model had a concordance statistic of 0·86 (95\% CI 0·79–0·94) in the validation cohort. Calibration plots indicated good agreement of predicted and observed outcomes.                                         Conclusions               The VENOMS score is a good predictor of the mortality in viper envenoming in southern India where Russell’s viper envenoming burden is high. The score may have potential applications in triaging patients and guiding management after further validation.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Risk factors associated with L. donovani visceral leishmaniasis (VL; kala azar) relapse are poorly characterized. METHODS: We investigated patient characteristics and drug regimens associated with VL relapse using data from Médecins Sans Frontières - Holland (MSF) treatment centres in Southern Sudan. We used MSF operational data to investigate trends in VL relapse and associated risk factors. RESULTS: We obtained data for 8,800 primary VL and 621 relapse VL patients treated between 1999 and 2007. Records of previous treatment for 166 VL relapse patients (26.7\%) were compared with 7,924 primary VL patients who had no record of subsequent relapse. Primary VL patients who relapsed had larger spleens on admission (Hackett grade {$>$}or=3 vs 0, odds ratio (OR) for relapse = 3.62 (95\% CI 1.08, 12.12)) and on discharge (Hackett grade {$>$}or=3 vs 0, OR = 5.50 (1.84, 16.49)). Age, sex, malnutrition, mobility, and complications of treatment were not associated with risk of relapse, nor was there any trend over time. Treatment with 17-day sodium stibogluconate/paromomycin (SSG/PM) combination therapy vs 30-day SSG monotherapy was associated with increased risk of relapse (OR = 2.08 (1.21, 3.58)) but reduced risk of death (OR = 0.27 (0.20, 0.37)), although these estimates are likely to be residually confounded. MSF operational data showed a crude upward trend in the proportion of VL relapse patients (annual percentage change (APC) = 11.4\% (-3.4\%, 28.5\%)) and a downward trend in deaths (APC = -18.1\% (-22.5\%, -13.4\%)). CONCLUSIONS: Splenomegaly and 17-day SSG/PM vs 30-day SSG were associated with increased risk of VL relapse. The crude upward trend in VL relapses in Southern Sudan may be attributable to improved access to treatment and reduced mortality due to SSG/PM combination therapy.},

  abstract     = {Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a potentially fatal disease caused mainly by Leishmania infantum in South America and Leishmania donovani in Asia and Africa. Disease outcomes have been associated with patient genotype, nutrition, age, sex, comorbidities, and coinfections. In this study, we examine the effects of parasite genetic variation on VL disease severity in Brazil. We collected and sequenced the genomes of 109 L. infantum isolates from patients in northeastern Brazil and retrieved matching patient clinical data from medical records, including mortality, sex, HIV coinfection, and laboratory data (creatinine, hemoglobin, and leukocyte and platelet counts). We identified genetic differences between parasite isolates, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), small insertions/deletions (indels), and variations in genic, intergenic, and chromosome copy numbers (copy number variants [CNVs]). To describe associations between the parasite genotypes and clinical outcomes, we applied quantitative genetics methods of heritability and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), treating clinical outcomes as traits that may be influenced by parasite genotype. Multiple aspects of the genetic analysis indicate that parasite genotype affects clinical outcomes. We estimate that parasite genotype explains 83\% chance of mortality (narrow-sense heritability [h2] = 0.83 6 0.17) and has a significant relationship with patient sex (h2 = 0.60 6 0.27). Impacts of parasite genotype on other clinical traits are lower (h2 \# 0.34). GWAS analysis identified multiple parasite genetic loci that were significantly associated with clinical outcomes; 17 CNVs were significantly associated with mortality, two with creatinine, and one with bacterial coinfection, jaundice, and HIV coinfection, and two SNPs/indels and six CNVs were associated with age, jaundice, HIV and bacterial coinfections, creatinine, and/or bleeding sites. Parasite genotype is an important factor in VL disease severity in Brazil. Our analysis indicates that specific genetic differences between parasites act as virulence factors, enhancing risks of severe disease and mortality. More detailed understanding of these virulence factors could be exploited for novel therapies.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Oral ivermectin is a safe broad spectrum anthelminthic used for treating several neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Currently, ivermectin use is contraindicated in children weighing less than 15 kg, restricting access to this drug for the treatment of NTDs. Here we provide an updated systematic review of the literature and we conducted an individual-level patient data (IPD) meta-analysis describing the safety of ivermectin in children weighing less than 15 kg. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A systematic review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) for IPD guidelines by searching MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid Embase, LILACS, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, TOXLINE for all clinical trials, case series, case reports, and database entries for reports on the use of ivermectin in children weighing less than 15 kg that were published between 1 January 1980 to 25 October 2019. The protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO): CRD42017056515. A total of 3,730 publications were identified, 97 were selected for potential inclusion, but only 17 sources describing 15 studies met the minimum criteria which consisted of known weights of children less than 15 kg linked to possible adverse events, and provided comprehensive IPD. A total of 1,088 children weighing less than 15 kg were administered oral ivermectin for one of the following indications: scabies, mass drug administration for scabies control, crusted scabies, cutaneous larva migrans, myiasis, pthiriasis, strongyloidiasis, trichuriasis, and parasitic disease of unknown origin. Overall a total of 1.4\% (15/1,088) of children experienced 18 adverse events all of which were mild and self-limiting. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Existing limited data suggest that oral ivermectin in children weighing less than 15 kilograms is safe. Data from well-designed clinical trials are needed to provide further assurance.},

  abstract     = {Health care provision is increasingly focused on the prediction of patients' individual risk for developing a particular health outcome in planning further tests and treatments. There has been a steady increase in the development and publication of prognostic models for various maternal and fetal outcomes in obstetrics. We undertook a systematic review to give an overview of the current status of available prognostic models in obstetrics in the context of their potential advantages and the process of developing and validating models. Important aspects to consider when assessing a prognostic model are discussed and recommendations on how to proceed on this within the obstetric domain are given. We searched MEDLINE (up to July 2012) for articles developing prognostic models in obstetrics. We identified 177 papers that reported the development of 263 prognostic models for 40 different outcomes. The most frequently predicted outcomes were preeclampsia (n~= 69), preterm delivery (n~= 63), mode of delivery (n~= 22), gestational hypertension (n~= 11), and small-for-gestational-age infants (n~= 10). The performance of newer models was generally not better than that of older models predicting the same outcome. The most important measures of predictive accuracy (ie, a model's discrimination and calibration) were often (82.9\%, 218/263) not both assessed. Very few developed models were validated in data other than the development data (8.7\%, 23/263). Only two-thirds of the papers (62.4\%, 164/263) presented the model such that validation in other populations was possible, and the clinical applicability was discussed in only 11.0\% (29/263). The impact of developed models on clinical practice was unknown. We identified a large number of prognostic models in obstetrics, but there is relatively little evidence about their performance, impact, and usefulness in clinical practice so that at this point, clinical implementation cannot be recommended. New efforts should be directed toward evaluating the performance and impact of the existing models.},

  abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a parasitic disease with an estimated 30\,000 new cases occurring annually. There is an observed variation in the efficacy of the current first-line therapies across different regions. Such heterogeneity could be a function of host, parasite and drug factors. An individual participant data meta-analysis (IPD-MA) is planned to explore the determinants of treatment outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO) VL living systematic review (IDDO VL LSR) library is an open-access resource of all published therapeutic studies in VL since 1980. For this current review, the search includes all clinical trials published between 1 January 1980 and 2 May 2021. Studies indexed in the IDDO VL LSR library were screened for eligibility for inclusion in this IPD-MA. Corresponding authors and principal investigators of the studies meeting the eligibility criteria for inclusion were invited to be part of the collaborative IPD-MA. Authors agreeing to participate in this collaborative research were requested to share the IPD using the IDDO VL data platform. The IDDO VL data platform currently holds data sets from clinical trials standardised to a common data format and provides a unique opportunity to identify host, parasite and drug determinants of treatment outcomes. Multivariable regression models will be constructed to identify determinants of therapeutic outcomes using generalised linear mixed-effects models accounting for within-study site clustering. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This IPD-MA meets the criteria for waiver of ethical review as defined by the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC) granted to IDDO, as the research consists of secondary analysis of existing anonymised data (Exempt granted on 29 March 2023, OxTREC REF: IDDO) Ethics approval was granted by the ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences ethics committee (Letter no: RMRI/EC/30/2022) on 04-07-2022. The results of this IPD-MA will be disseminated at conferences, IDDO website and any peer-reviewed publications. All publications will be open source. Findings of this research will be critically important for the control programmes at regional/global levels, policy makers and groups developing new VL treatments.

  abstract     = {Dengue is among the fastest-spreading vector-borne infectious disease, with outbreaks often overwhelm the health system and result in huge morbidity and mortality in its endemic populations in the absence of an efficient warning system. A large number of prediction models are currently in use globally. As such, this study aimed to systematically review the published literature that used quantitative models to predict dengue outbreaks and provide insights about the current practices. A systematic search was undertaken, using the Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science databases for published citations, without time or geographical restrictions. Study selection, data extraction and management process were devised in accordance with the ‘Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies’ (‘CHARMS’) framework. A total of 99 models were included in the review from 64 studies. Most models sourced climate (94.7\%) and climate change (77.8\%) data from agency reports and only 59.6\% of the models adjusted for reporting time lag. All included models used climate predictors; 70.7\% of them were built with only climate factors. Climate factors were used in combination with climate change factors (13.4\%), both climate change and demographic factors (3.1\%), vector factors (6.3\%), and demographic factors (5.2\%). Machine learning techniques were used for 39.4\% of the models. Of these, random forest (15.4\%), neural networks (23.1\%) and ensemble models (10.3\%) were notable. Among the statistical (60.6\%) models, linear regression (18.3\%), Poisson regression (18.3\%), generalized additive models (16.7\%) and time series/autoregressive models (26.7\%) were notable. Around 20.2\% of the models reported no validation at all and only 5.2\% reported external validation. The reporting of methodology and model performance measures were inadequate in many of the existing prediction models. This review collates plausible predictors and methodological approaches, which will contribute to robust modelling in diverse settings and populations.},

  abstract     = {Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis task that has received widespread attention in the visualization community. The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.},

  abstract     = {Effective ways to identify and predict men who have sex with men (MSM) at substantial risk for HIV is a global priority. HIV risk assessment tools can improve individual risk awareness and subsequent health-seeking actions. We sought to identify and characterize the performance of HIV infection risk prediction models in MSM through systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Embase, and The Cochrane Library were searched. Eighteen HIV infection risk assessment models with a total of 151,422 participants and 3643 HIV cases were identified, eight of which have been externally validated by at least one study (HIRI-MSM, Menza Score, SDET Score, Li Model, DHRS, Amsterdam Score, SexPro model, and UMRSS). The number of predictor variables in each model ranged from three to 12, age, the number of male sexual partners, unprotected receptive anal intercourse, recreational drug usage (amphetamines, poppers), and sexually transmitted infections were critical scoring variables. All eight externally validated models performed well in terms of discrimination, with the pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) ranging from 0.62 (95\%CI: 0.51 to 0.73, SDET Score) to 0.83 (95\%CI: 0.48 to 0.99, Amsterdam Score). Calibration performance was only reported in 10 studies (35.7\%, 10/28). The HIV infection risk prediction models showed moderate-to-good discrimination performance. Validation of prediction models across different geographic and ethnic environments is needed to ensure their real-world application.},

  abstract     = {Background and Objectives: In Brazil, as in many other affected countries, a large proportion of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) occurs in remote locations and treatment is often performed on basis of clinical suspicion. This study aimed at developing predictive models to help with the clinical management of VL in patients with suggestive clinical of disease. Methods: Cases of VL (n = 213) had the diagnosis confirmed by parasitological method, non-cases (n = 119) presented suggestive clinical presentation of VL but a negative parasitological diagnosis and a firm diagnosis of another disease. The original data set was divided into two samples for generation and validation of the prediction models. Prediction models based on clinical signs and symptoms, results of laboratory exams and results of five different serological tests, were developed by means of logistic regression and classification and regression trees (CART). From these models, clinicallaboratory and diagnostic prediction scores were generated. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were used to evaluate the models’ performance. Results: Based on the variables splenomegaly, presence of cough and leukopenia and on the results of five serological tests it was possible to generate six predictive models using logistic regression, showing sensitivity ranging from 90.1 to 99.0\% and specificity ranging from 53.0 to 97.2\%. Based on the variables splenomegaly, leukopenia, cough, age and weight loss and on the results of five serological tests six predictive models were generated using CART with sensitivity ranging from 90.1 to 97.2\% and specificity ranging from 68.4 to 97.4\%. The models composed of clinical-laboratory variables and the rk39 rapid test showed the best performance. Conclusion: The predictive models showed to be a potential useful tool to assist healthcare systems and control programs in their strategical choices, contributing to more efficient and more rational allocation of healthcare resources.},

  abstract     = {A real-time PCR was developed to quantify Leishmania infantum kinetoplast DNA and optimized to reach a sensitivity of 0.0125 parasites/ml of blood. In order to analyze the incidence of heterogeneity and number of minicircles, we performed comparative PCR by using the Leishmania DNA polymerase gene as a reporter. Assays performed in both promastigote and amastigote stages showed variations among different L. infantum and Leishmania donovani strains and the stability of the minicircle numbers for a particular strain. Analysis of blood samples from a patient who presented with Mediterranean visceral leishmaniasis confirmed the reliability of such an assay for Leishmania quantification in biological samples and allowed an estimation of positivity thresholds of classical tests used for direct diagnosis of the disease; positivity thresholds were in the range of 18 to 42, 0.7 to 42, and 0.12 to 22.5 parasites/ml for microscopic examination, culture, and conventional PCR, respectively. At the time of diagnosis, parasitemia could vary by a wide range (32 to 188,700 parasites/ml, with a median of 837 parasites/ml), while in bone marrow, parasite load was more than 100 parasites per 10(6) nucleated human cells. After successful therapy, parasitemia levels remain lower than 1 parasite/ml. In the immunocompromised host, relapses correlate with an increase in the level of parasitemia, sometimes scanty, justifying the need for assays with high sensitivity. Such sensitivity allows the detection of Leishmania DNA in the blood of 21\% of patients with no history of leishmaniasis living in the Marseilles area, where leishmaniasis is endemic. This technique may be useful for epidemiologic and diagnostic purposes, especially for the quantification of parasitemia at low levels during posttherapy follow-up.},

Miltefosine, the only oral treatment, failed to achieve adequate efficacy, particularly in children, in whom linear dosing (2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days) resulted in a 59\% cure rate, with lower systemic exposure than in adults.                                         Methods               We conducted a Phase II trial in 30 children with visceral leishmaniasis, aged 4–12 years, to test whether 28 days of allometric miltefosine dosing safely achieves a higher systemic exposure than linear dosing.                                         Results               Miltefosine accumulated during treatment. Median areas under the concentration time curve from days 0–210 and plasma maximum concentration values were slightly higher than those reported previously for children on linear dosing, but not dose-proportionally. Miltefosine exposure at the start of treatment was increased, with higher median plasma concentrations on day 7 (5.88 versus 2.67 μg/mL). Concentration-time curves were less variable, avoiding the low levels of exposure observed with linear dosing. The 210-day cure rate was 90\% (95\% confidence interval, 73–98\%), similar to that previously described in adults. There were 19 treatment-related adverse events (AEs), but none caused treatment discontinuation. There were 2 serious AEs: both were unrelated to treatment and both patients were fully recovered.                                         Conclusions               Allometric miltefosine dosing achieved increased and less-variable exposure than linear dosing, though not reaching the expected exposure levels. The new dosing regimen safely increased the efficacy of miltefosine for Eastern African children with visceral leishmaniasis. Further development of miltefosine should adopt allometric dosing in pediatric patients.                                         Clinical Trials Registration               NCT02431143.},

  abstract     = {Abstract             In visceral leishmaniasis, chemotherapy probably seldom eradicates all parasites in tissue macrophages; nevertheless, most T cell-intact patients show long-lasting clinical cure after treatment despite residual intracellular infection. To characterize prevention of posttreatment relapse, amphotericin B was used to kill ∼90–95\% of Leishmania donovani in livers of mice deficient in mechanisms of acquired antileishmanial resistance. Recrudescence subsequently developed 1) in animals deficient in both CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as CD40L-mediated T cell costimulation, but not in a) CD4 or CD8 cells alone, b) NK cell lytic activity, or c) ICAM-1-recruited monocytes; and 2) in mice deficient in IFN-γ, but not in the IFN-γ-inducing cytokines, a) IL-12, b) IL-12 and IL-23, or c) IL-18. Posttreatment recrudescence also did not develop in animals deficient in macrophage phagocyte NADPH oxidase (phox) or inducible NO synthase (iNOS) alone or, surprisingly, in those deficient in both phox and iNOS. Therefore, regulation of the intracellular replication of residual Leishmania donovani that escape chemotherapy evolves to a host mechanism distinguishable from initial acquired resistance at the T cell, cytokine, and macrophage levels. Posttreatment, either CD8 or CD4 cells can direct the response, IL-12 is not required, and iNOS and phox, the activated macrophage’s primary IFN-γ-inducible leishmanicidal pathways, both become dispensable.},

Provision of treatment during endemic periods and as an emergency response is impeded by instability and conflict. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has provided health care in South Sudan since the late 1980’s, including treatment for 67,000 VL patients. In recent years, MSF monitoring data have indicated increasing numbers of VL relapse cases. A retrospective analysis of these data was performed in order to provide insight into the possible causes of this increase.                                         Methodology/Principal findings               Programme monitoring data from the MSF hospital in Lankien, Jonglei State, South Sudan, for the period 2001–2018 were analysed to detect trends in VL relapse as a proportion of all VL cases presenting to MSF treatment centres. Routinely collected patient-level data from relapse and primary VL cases treated at all MSF sites in South Sudan over the same period were analysed to describe patient characteristics and treatments received. VL relapse as a proportion of all VL cases increased by 6.5\% per annum (95\% CI 0.3\% to 13.0\%, p = 0.04), from 5.2\% during 2001–2003 to 14.4\% during 2016–2018. Primary VL and VL relapse patients had similar age, sex and anthropometric characteristics, the latter indicating high indices of undernutrition which were relatively constant over time. Clinical factors (Hb, spleen size, and VL severity score) also did not vary substantially over time. SSG/PM was the main treatment regimen from 2001–2018, used in 68.7\% of primary and 70.9\% of relapse VL cases; AmBisome was introduced in 2013, received by 22.5\% of primary VL and 32.6\% of VL relapse cases from 2013–2018.                                         Conclusion               Increasing incidence of VL relapse in South Sudan does not appear to be explained by changes in patient characteristics or other factors. Our data are concerning and may indicate an emergence of treatment-resistant parasite strains, decreasing the effectiveness of treatment regimens. This warrants further investigation as a causal factor. New chemical entities that will enable safe and highly effective short-course oral treatments for VL are urgently needed.},

  abstract     = {Objective               Malaria infection could result in severe disease with high mortality. Prognostic models and scores predicting severity of infection, complications and mortality could help clinicians prioritise patients. We conducted a systematic review to assess the various models that have been produced to predict disease severity and mortality in patients infected with malaria.                                         Design               A systematic review.                                         Data sources               Medline, Global health and CINAHL were searched up to 4 September 2019.                                         Eligibility criteria for selecting studies               Published articles on models which used at least two points (or variables) of patient data to predict disease severity; potential development of complications (including coma or cerebral malaria; shock; acidosis; severe anaemia; acute kidney injury; hypoglycaemia; respiratory failure and sepsis) and mortality in patients with malaria infection.                                         Data extraction and synthesis               Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed risk of bias using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool.                                         Results               A total of 564 articles were screened and 24 articles were retained which described 27 models/scores of interests. Two of the articles described models predicting complications of malaria (severe anaemia in children and development of sepsis); 15 articles described original models predicting mortality in severe malaria; 3 articles described models predicting mortality in different contexts but adapted and validated to predict mortality in malaria; and 4 articles described models predicting severity of the disease. For the models predicting mortality, all the models had neurological dysfunction as a predictor; in children, half of the models contained hypoglycaemia and respiratory failure as a predictor meanwhile, six out of the nine models in adults had respiratory failure as a clinical predictor. Acidosis, renal failure and shock were also common predictors of mortality. Eighteen of the articles described models that could be applicable in real-life settings and all the articles had a high risk of bias due to lack of use of consistent and up-to-date methods of internal validation.                                         Conclusion               Evidence is lacking on the generalisability of most of these models due lack of external validation. Emphasis should be placed on external validation of existing models and publication of the findings of their use in clinical settings to guide clinicians on management options depending on the priorities of their patients.

This study aimed to identify factors associated with death from VL in the State of Piaui, Brazil. Methods: Case-control study evaluating the following putative risk factors for death from VL: gender and age of the patient, local of residence, signs, and symptoms, laboratory data, comorbidities and days of evolution of the disease. The associations between risk factors and death were expressed as odds ratios and their respective 95\% confidence intervals. Results: In the period analyzed a total of 2525 VL patients were admitted to the hospital, corresponding to 9,3\% of all VL admissions in Brazil. Among them, 177 patients died (case-fatality rate of 7.0\%). In the multivariate analysis the following variables showed a statistically significant association with death: ≥60 years, vomiting, edema, diarrhea, platelets {$<$} 50.000/mm3, jaundice, splenomegaly, and pneumonia. Conclusions: The identified factors associated to death from VL can be easily assessed at the time of or up to 48 h after admission and may be used to inform clinical decisions, improving the clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients.},

Main text: Herein, we argue that this needs to change immediately because poorly calibrated algorithms can be misleading and potentially harmful for clinical decision-making. We summarize how to avoid poor calibration at algorithm development and how to assess calibration at algorithm validation, emphasizing balance between model complexity and the available sample size. At external validation, calibration curves require sufficiently large samples. Algorithm updating should be considered for appropriate support of clinical practice. Conclusion: Efforts are required to avoid poor calibration when developing prediction models, to evaluate calibration when validating models, and to update models when indicated. The ultimate aim is to optimize the utility of predictive analytics for shared decision-making and patient counseling.},

Methods                                We developed standard case definitions for early and late                 VL                 treatment outcomes, a single register allowing for one‐line entry per patient as registration tool, and quarterly reporting formats for the clinical outcomes. We pilot‐tested these tools in three                 I                 ndian                 P                 rimary                 H                 ealth                 C                 entres and two                 N                 epalese district hospitals, as well as in a charity                 VL                 treatment centre and a university hospital.                                                        Results               Data collection for early treatment outcome was easily implemented but information on late treatment outcome was hard to obtain. Effectiveness of Miltefosine under routine care conditions was about 87\% at end of treatment, and 76\% at 6~months post‐treatment related to the high number of patients lost to follow up at the latter end point.                                         Conclusion                                A retrospective cohort monitoring methodology is conceptually a good framework for monitoring clinical outcomes for chronic conditions as                 VL                 . The monitoring of early outcomes of                 VL                 treatment is perfectly feasible in                 P                 rimary                 C                 are settings. The completeness of information on late outcomes can be improved by a number of strategies that remain to be field tested. Generally, clinical outcome monitoring should be strengthened in the                 VL                 control programmes.                                       ,                             Objectif                                Evaluer un nouvel outil pour le suivi des résultats du traitement de la                 LV                 dans les établissements de soins primaires, adapté à partir du Suivi de Cohorte Rétrospective Trimestrielle standardisé, utilisé dans la lutte antituberculeuse.                                                        Méthodes                                Nous avons élaboré des définitions de cas standard pour les résultats précoces ou tardifs du traitement de la                 LV                 , un registre unique permettant une ligne de saisie par patient comme outil d'enregistrement et des formats de reports trimestriels pour les résultats cliniques. Nous avons mis à l'essai ces outils dans trois centres de santé primaires en Inde, dans deux hôpitaux de district Népalais, ainsi que dans un centre du traitement de charité de la                 LV                 et un hôpital universitaire.                                                        Résultats               La collecte des données pour les résultats précoces du traitement a été facilement mise en œuvre mais l'information sur les résultats tardifs du traitement était difficile à obtenir. L'efficacité de la miltéfosine dans des conditions de soins de routine était d'environ 87\% à la fin du traitement et 76\% à 6 mois post‐traitement, liée au nombre élevé de patients perdus au suivi lors du dernier point de suivi.                                         Conclusion                                Une méthodologie de suivi de cohorte rétrospective est conceptuellement un bon cadre pour le suivi des résultats cliniques des maladies chroniques comme la                 LV                 . Le suivi des résultats précoces du traitement de la                 LV                 est parfaitement réalisable dans les milieux de soins primaires. L'exhaustivité de l'information sur les résultats tardifs peut être améliorée par un certain nombre de stratégies qui sont à tester sur le terrain. En général le suivi des résultats cliniques doit être renforcé dans les programmes de lutte contre la                 LV                 .                                       ,                             Objetivo                                Evaluar una nueva herramienta para la monitorización de los resultados del tratamiento de la Leishmaniasis Visceral (                 LV                 ) en centros de atención primaria, adaptado de la Monitorización Trimestral Retrospectiva de Cohortes realizada para el control de la tuberculosis.                                                        Métodos                                Hemos desarrollado definiciones de caso estándares para los resultados tempranos y tardíos del tratamiento de la                 LV                 , un registro único que permite entrar una línea por paciente como herramienta de registro, y formatos de reporte trimestral para los resultados clínicos. Hicimos una prueba piloto de estas herramientas en tres Centros de Atención Primaria de la India y dos Hospitales Distritales de Nepal, al igual que en un centro de tratamiento caritativo y un Hospital Universitario.                                                        Resultados               La recolección de datos de resultados tempranos del tratamiento fue implementado fácilmente, pero la información sobre los resultados tardíos del tratamiento fue difícil de obtener. La efectividad de Miltefosina bajo condiciones de cuidados rutinarios era de aproximadamente un 87\% al final del tratamiento, y del 76\% a los 6 meses de terminar el tratamiento, relacionado con el alto número de pacientes perdidos durante el seguimiento en esta última etapa.                                         Conclusión                                Una metodología de monitorización retrospectiva de cohortes es conceptualmente un buen marco para la monitorización de resultados clínicos para condiciones crónicas tales como la                 LV                 . La monitorización de resultados tempranos del tratamiento de la                 LV                 es perfectamente factible en centros de atención primaria. Es posible mejorar el nivel de integridad de la información sobre los resultados tardíos mediante un número de estrategias que aún han de probarse en el terreno. En general debería reforzarse la monitorización de los resultados clínicos en programas de control de la                 LV                 .},

  abstract     = {Liposomal amphotericin B is being used increasingly to reduce the burden of kala-azar from the Indian subcontinent. There are studies which have evaluated efficacy and safety of liposomal amphotericin B for visceral leishmaniasis in all age groups. However, the only study that specifically addressed treatment of childhood visceral leishmaniasis did not include all ages or document renal and liver function. We, therefore, felt it was important to reassess the efficacy and safety of single dose liposomal amphotericin B in children and adolescents. A total of 100 parasitologically confirmed visceral leishmaniasis patients aged {$<$} 15 years were included in this study. Participants consisted of 65 males and 35 females. All of them had come from the endemic region of Bihar. They were administered one dose intravenous infusion of liposomal amphptericin B at 10 mg/kg body weight. Efficacy was assessed as initial and final cure at 1 and 6 months, respectively, and safety of all participants who were recruited in the study. The initial and final cure rate by per protocol analysis was 100\% and 97.9\%, respectively. Chills and rigors were the most commonly occurring adverse events (AEs). All the AEs were mild in intensity, and none of the patients experienced any serious AEs. No patients developed nephrotoxicity. Our finding indicates that liposomal amphotericin B at 10 mg/kg body weight is safe and effective in children. Results of our study support the use of single dose liposomal amphotericin B in all age group populations for elimination of kala-azar from the Indian subcontinent.},

  abstract     = {Miltefosine, the only oral drug for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is being used as the first-line drug under the VL elimination program in the Indian subcontinent. Miltefosine is an oral drug which was used as a topical application for skin metastasis of breast cancer. It was found to be effective against               Leishmania donovani               . The main adverse events (AE) reported previously with miltefosine use includes diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. Other AEs include, raised serum alanine transaminase/aspartate aminotransferase and renal parameters such as creatinine. In this study, we report AEs in a large patient cohort of VL treated with miltefosine. The purpose of this pharmacovigilance study was to assess adverse drug reactions (ADRs)/AE of miltefosine treatment under unrestricted condition in the field setup. Patients were followed up to 6 months for therapeutic effectiveness. Outcomes of a larger data set of patients treated with this regimen from April 2012 to March 2015 were recorded. In the present study, 646 patients of VL were given miltefosine. Majority of the study subjects (58\%) were male. Relapse occurred in 7\% during follow-up period. Main causes of death were VL–pulmonary tuberculosis coinfection, extreme diarrhea, and acute pancreatitis which were reported in 1.7\% subjects. Of 553 (85.6\%) patients completing full course of treatment, 463 (83.7\%) showed ADR with miltefosine during the study period. About 2.3\% were suffering severe ADR, 51\% from moderate, and the rest had mild ADR. The initial and final cure rate was 97.4\% and 85.6\%, respectively.},

We evaluated miltefosine in a phase IV trial of 977 patients in Bangladesh. At the six-month final follow up, 701 were cured. 24 showed initial treatment failure, and 95 showed treatment failure at 6 months, although 73 of the 95 showed treatment failure solely by the criterion of low hemoglobin values. One hundred twenty-one patients were not assessable. With the conservative assumption that all low hemoglobin values represented treatment failure, the final per protocol cure rate was 85\%. Of 13 severe adverse events, 6 led to treatment discontinuation and 7 resulted in deaths, but only 1 death (associated with diarrhea) could be attributed to drug. Nearly all non-serious adverse events were gastrointestinal: vomiting in 25\% of patients and diarrhea in 8\% of patients. Oral miltefosine is an attractive alternative to intramuscular antimony and intravenous amphotericin B for treatment of kala-azar in Bangladesh.},

  abstract     = {Leishmania donovani is an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes leishmaniasis, which can range from a self-healing cutaneous disease to a fatal visceral disease depending on the infecting species. Miltefosine is currently the latest and only oral antileishmanial that came out of drug discovery pipelines in the past few decades, but recent reports indicate a significant decline in its efficacy against visceral leishmaniasis (also known as kala-azar) in the Indian subcontinent. This relapse rate of up to 20\% within 12 months after treatment was shown not to be related to reinfection, drug quality, drug exposure, or drug-resistant parasites. We therefore aimed to assess other phenotypes of the parasite that may affect treatment outcome and found a significant association between the number of metacyclic parasites, parasite infectivity, and patient treatment outcome in the Indian subcontinent. Together with previous studies on resistance of L. donovani against pentavalent antimonials, these data suggest that the infectivity of the parasite, or related phenotypes, might be a more determinant factor for treatment failure in visceral leishmaniasis than drug susceptibility, warranting a reassessment of our current view on treatment failure and drug resistance in leishmaniasis and beyond. IMPORTANCE: The high miltefosine relapse rate poses a major challenge for the current Kala-Azar Elimination Program in the Indian subcontinent and other leishmaniasis control programs worldwide. This relapse rate could not be related to reinfection, drug-resistant parasites, or reduced treatment quality. Here we report that an increased infectivity of the parasite is associated with miltefosine relapse of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients. These results supplement those obtained with antimonial-resistant L. donovani where an increased infectivity was also observed. This challenges the current view of Leishmania drug susceptibility being the biggest parasitic factor that contributes to treatment failure in leishmaniasis. These selected more infectious parasites may pose an additional burden to leishmaniasis control programs, highlighting the importance of multifaceted control measures to achieve leishmaniasis elimination in the Indian subcontinent and other regions where leishmaniasis is endemic.},

However, relatively few models are externally validated and validation by independent researchers is rare. External validation is necessary to determine a prediction model’s reproducibility and generalizability to new and different patients. Various methodological considerations are important when assessing or designing an external validation study. In this article, an overview is provided of these considerations, starting with what external validation is, what types of external validation can be distinguished and why such studies are a crucial step towards the clinical implementation of accurate prediction models. Statistical analyses and interpretation of external validation results are reviewed in an intuitive manner and considerations for selecting an appropriate existing prediction model and external validation population are discussed. This study enables clinicians and researchers to gain a deeper understanding of how to interpret model validation results and how to translate these results to their own patient population.},

Predictive accuracy and practicality of models varies depending on methods used for their development, and should be evaluated. The aim of this study was to summarize currently available CPM for invasive candidiasis, analyze their performance, and assess their suitability for use in clinical decision making. We identified studies that described the construction of a CPM for invasive candidiasis from PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library databases, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Data extracted included: author, data source, study design, recruitment period, characteristics of study population, outcome types, predictor types, number of study participants and outcome events, modelling method, and list of predictors used in the final model. Calibration and discrimination in the derivative datasets were used to assess the performance of each model. Ten articles were identified in our search and included for full text review. Five models were developed using data from ICUs, and five models included all hospitalized patients. The findings of this review highlight the limitations of currently available models to predict invasive candidiasis, including lack of generalizability, difficulty in everyday clinical use, and overly optimistic performance. There are significant concerns regarding predictive performance and usability in every day practice of existing CPM to predict invasive candidiasis.},

  abstract     = {Introduction: Having reliable predictive models of prognosis/the risk of infection in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients would allow this problem to be addressed on an individual basis to study and implement possible preventive or therapeutic interventions. Objective: To identify and analyze all predictive models of prognosis/the risk of infection in patients with SLE that exist in medical literature. Methods: A structured search in PubMed, Embase, and LILACS databases was carried out until May 9, 2020. In addition, a search for abstracts in the American Congress of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) annual meetings’ archives published over the past eight years was also conducted. Studies on developing, validating or updating predictive prognostic models carried out in patients with SLE, in which the outcome to be predicted is some type of infection, that were generated in any clinical context and with any time horizon were included. There were no restrictions on language, date, or status of the publication. To carry out the systematic review, the CHARMS (Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies) guideline recommendations were followed. The PROBAST tool (A Tool to Assess the Risk of Bias and Applicability of Prediction Model Studies) was used to assess the risk of bias and the applicability of each model. Results: We identified four models of infection prognosis in patients with SLE. Mostly, there were very few events per candidate predictor. In addition, to construct the models, an initial selection was made based on univariate analyses with no contraction of the estimated coefficients being carried out. This suggests that the proposed models have a high probability of overfitting and being optimistic. Conclusions: To date, very few prognostic models have been published on the infection of SLE patients. These models are very heterogeneous and are rated as having a high risk of bias and methodological weaknesses. Despite the widespread recognition of the frequency and severity of infections in SLE patients, there is no reliable predictive prognostic model that facilitates the study and implementation of personalized preventive or therapeutic measures.},

  abstract     = {When designing a study to develop a new prediction model with binary or time‐to‐event outcomes, researchers should ensure their sample size is adequate in terms of the number of participants (               n               ) and outcome events (               E               ) relative to the number of predictor parameters (               p               ) considered for inclusion. We propose that the minimum values of               n               and               E               (and subsequently the minimum number of events per predictor parameter, EPP) should be calculated to meet the following three criteria: (i) small optimism in predictor effect estimates as defined by a global shrinkage factor of               ≥               0.9, (ii) small absolute difference of               ≤               0.05 in the model's apparent and adjusted Nagelkerke's                                R                 2                              , and (iii) precise estimation of the overall risk in the population. Criteria (i) and (ii) aim to reduce overfitting conditional on a chosen               p               , and require prespecification of the model's anticipated Cox‐Snell                                R                 2                              , which we show can be obtained from previous studies.

Upon application of our approach, a new diagnostic model for Chagas disease requires an EPP of at least 4.8 and a new prognostic model for recurrent venous thromboembolism requires an EPP of at least 23. This reinforces why rules of thumb (eg, 10 EPP) should be avoided. Researchers might additionally ensure the sample size gives precise estimates of key predictor effects; this is especially important when key categorical predictors have few events in some categories, as this may substantially increase the numbers required.},

  abstract     = {In 2019 we published a pair of articles in               Statistics in Medicine               that describe how to calculate the minimum sample size for developing a multivariable prediction model with a continuous outcome, or with a binary or time‐to‐event outcome. As for any sample size calculation, the approach requires the user to specify anticipated values for key parameters. In particular, for a prediction model with a binary outcome, the outcome proportion and a conservative estimate for the overall fit of the developed model as measured by the Cox‐Snell               R               2               (proportion of variance explained) must be specified. This proposal raises the question of how to identify a plausible value for               R               2               in advance of model development. Our articles suggest researchers should identify               R               2               from closely related models already published in their field. In this letter, we present details on how to derive               R               2               using the reported               C               statistic (AUROC) for such existing prediction models with a binary outcome. The               C               statistic is commonly reported, and so our approach allows researchers to obtain               R               2               for subsequent sample size calculations for new models. Stata and R code is provided, and a small simulation study.},

The reason may be that since in most cases models have not been validated in independent data, they lack generality and/or credibility. In this paper we consider the situation in which several compatible, independent data sets relating to a given disease with a time‐to‐event endpoint are available for analysis. The aim is to construct and evaluate a single prognostic model. Building a multivariable model from the available prognostic factors is accomplished within the Cox proportional hazards framework, stratifying by study. Non‐linear relationships with continuous predictors are modelled by using fractional polynomials. To assess the discrimination or separation of a survival model, we use the               D               statistic of Royston and Sauerbrei.               D               may be interpreted as the separation (log hazard ratio) between the survival distributions for two independent prognostic groups. To evaluate the generality of a prognostic model across the data sets, we propose ‘internal–external cross‐validation’ on               D               : each study is omitted in turn, the model parameters are estimated from the remaining studies and               D               is evaluated in the omitted study. Because the linear predictor of a survival model tells only part of the story, we also suggest a method for investigating heterogeneity in the baseline distribution function across studies which involves fitting completely specified, flexible parametric survival models (Royston and Parmar). Our final models combine the prognostic index (obtained with stratification by study) with the pooled baseline survival distribution (estimated parametrically). By applying this methodology, we construct two prognostic scores in superficial bladder cancer. The simpler of the two scores is more suited to clinical application. We show that a three‐group prognostic classification scheme based on either score produces well‐separated survival curves for each of the data sets, despite identifiable heterogeneity among the baseline distribution functions and to a lesser extent among the prognostic indexes for the individual studies.

The main objective of the study was to provide a complete picture of performance of prediction models for early detection of neonatal sepsis. Methods\enspace{} PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL databases were searched and articles which used various prediction modelling measures for the early detection of neonatal sepsis were comprehended. Data extraction was carried out based on Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies checklist. Extricate data consisted of objective, study design, patient characteristics, type of statistical model, predictors, outcome, sample size and location. Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was applied to gauge the risk of bias of the articles. Results\enspace{} An aggregate of ten studies were included in the review among which eight studies had applied logistic regression to build a prediction model, while the remaining two had applied artificial intelligence. Potential predictors like neonatal fever, birth weight, foetal morbidity and gender, cervicovaginitis and maternal age were identified for the early detection of neonatal sepsis. Moreover, birth weight, endotracheal intubation, thyroid hypofunction and umbilical venous catheter were promising factors for predicting late-onset sepsis; while gestational age, intrapartum temperature and antibiotics treatment were utilised as budding prognosticators for early-onset sepsis detection. Conclusion\enspace{} Prediction modelling approaches were able to recognise promising maternal, neonatal and laboratory predictors in the rapid detection of early and late neonatal sepsis and thus, can be considered as a novel way for clinician decisionmaking towards the disease diagnosis if not used alone, in the years to come.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Malaria in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are a highly effective, first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, except in the first trimester of pregnancy, when quinine with clindamycin is recommended due to concerns about the potential embryotoxicity of artemisinins. We compared adverse pregnancy outcomes after artemisinin-based treatment (ABT) versus non-ABTs in the first trimester of pregnancy. METHODS: For this systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Malaria in Pregnancy Library for prospective cohort studies published between Nov 1, 2015, and Dec 21, 2021, containing data on outcomes of pregnancies exposed to ABT and non-ABT in the first trimester. The results of this search were added to those of a previous systematic review that included publications published up until November, 2015. We included pregnancies enrolled before the pregnancy outcome was known. We excluded pregnancies with missing estimated gestational age or exposure information, multiple gestation pregnancies, and if the fetus was confirmed to be unviable before antimalarial treatment. The primary endpoint was adverse pregnancy outcome, defined as a composite of either miscarriage, stillbirth, or major congenital anomalies. A one-stage IPD meta-analysis was done by use of shared-frailty Cox models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015032371. FINDINGS: We identified seven eligible studies that included 12 cohorts. All 12 cohorts contributed IPD, including 34\,178 pregnancies, 737 with confirmed first-trimester exposure to ABTs and 1076 with confirmed first-trimester exposure to non-ABTs. Adverse pregnancy outcomes occurred in 42 (5·7\%) of 736 ABT-exposed pregnancies compared with 96 (8·9\%) of 1074 non-ABT-exposed pregnancies in the first trimester (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0·71, 95\% CI 0·49-1·03). Similar results were seen for the individual components of miscarriage (aHR=0·74, 0·47-1·17), stillbirth (aHR=0·71, 0·32-1·57), and major congenital anomalies (aHR=0·60, 0·13-2·87). The risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes was lower with artemether-lumefantrine than with oral quinine in the first trimester of pregnancy (25 [4·8\%] of 524 vs 84 [9·2\%] of 915; aHR 0·58, 0·36-0·92). INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity based on the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or major congenital anomalies associated with ABT during the first trimester of pregnancy. Given that treatment with artemether-lumefantrine was associated with fewer adverse pregnancy outcomes than quinine, and because of the known superior tolerability and antimalarial effectiveness of ACTs, artemether-lumefantrine should be considered the preferred treatment for uncomplicated P falciparum malaria in the first trimester. If artemether-lumefantrine is unavailable, other ACTs (except artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) should be preferred to quinine. Continued active pharmacovigilance is warranted.

  abstract     = {Background: Despite the major public health importance of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Latin America, well-designed studies to inform diagnosis, treatment and control interventions are scarce. Few observational studies address prognostic assessment in patients with VL. This study aimed to identify risk factors for death in children aged less than 15 years admitted for VL treatment in a referral center in northeast Brazil. Methodology/Principal Findings: In a retrospective cohort, we reviewed 546 records of patients younger than 15 years admitted with the diagnosis of VL at the Instituto de Medicina Integral Professor Fernando Figueira between May 1996 and June 2006. Age ranged from 4 months to 13.7 years, and 275 (50\%) were male. There were 57 deaths, with a case-fatality rate of 10\%. In multivariate logistic regression, the independent predictors of risk of dying from VL were (adjusted OR, 95\% CI): mucosal bleeding (4.1, 1.3–13.4), jaundice (4.4, 1.7–11.2), dyspnea (2.8, 1.2–6.1), suspected or confirmed bacterial infections (2.7, 1.2–6.1), neutrophil count ,500/mm3 (3.1, 1.4–6.9) and platelet count ,50,000/mm3 (11.7, 5.4–25.1). A prognostic score was proposed and had satisfactory sensitivity (88.7\%) and specificity (78.5\%). Conclusions/Significance: Prognostic and severity markers can be useful to inform clinical decisions such as whether a child with VL can be safely treated in the local healthcare facility or would potentially benefit from transfer to referral centers where advanced life support facilities are available. High risk patients may benefit from interventions such as early use of extended-spectrum antibiotics or transfusion of blood products. These baseline risk-based supportive interventions should be assessed in clinical trials.},

  abstract     = {Many modern estimators require bootstrapping to calculate confidence intervals because either no analytic standard error is available or the distribution of the parameter of interest is nonsymmetric. It remains however unclear how to obtain valid bootstrap inference when dealing with multiple imputation to address missing data. We present 4 methods that are intuitively appealing, easy to implement, and combine bootstrap estimation with multiple imputation. We show that 3 of the 4 approaches yield valid inference, but that the performance of the methods varies with respect to the number of imputed data sets and the extent of missingness. Simulation studies reveal the behavior of our approaches in finite samples. A topical analysis from HIV treatment research, which determines the optimal timing of antiretroviral treatment initiation in young children, demonstrates the practical implications of the 4 methods in a sophisticated and realistic setting. This analysis suffers from missing data and uses theg‐formula for inference, a method for which no standard errors are available.},

  abstract     = {If individual participant data are available from multiple studies or clusters, then a prediction model can be externally validated multiple times. This allows the model’s discrimination and calibration performance to be examined across different settings. Random-effects meta-analysis can then be used to quantify overall (average) performance and heterogeneity in performance. This typically assumes a normal distribution of ‘true’ performance across studies. We conducted a simulation study to examine this normality assumption for various performance measures relating to a logistic regression prediction model. We simulated data across multiple studies with varying degrees of variability in baseline risk or predictor effects and then evaluated the shape of the between-study distribution in the C-statistic, calibration slope, calibration-in-the-large, and E/O statistic, and possible transformations thereof. We found that a normal between-study distribution was usually reasonable for the calibration slope and calibration-in-the-large; however, the distributions of the C-statistic and E/O were often skewed across studies, particularly in settings with large variability in the predictor effects. Normality was vastly improved when using the logit transformation for the C-statistic and the log transformation for E/O, and therefore we recommend these scales to be used for meta-analysis.

When covariate information on patients is available, logistic regression and other multivariate techniques are often used to select prognostic factors and create predictive models. An example shows how the explicit aim of prediction needs to be taken into account in such modelling, and how predictive performance may be assessed by decomposition of a scoring rule. Secondly, results from a program that provides pretrial and interim predictions in clinical trials are displayed, bringing together the use of subjective opinion, Bayesian methodology and techniques for evaluating and criticizing predictions.},

  abstract     = {Many attempts have been made to support clinical decisions by formal statistical reasoning, but the practical impact of these efforts has been limited. Developers of "expert systems", who use the techniques of artificial intelligence to represent clinicians' personal "knowledge", have suggested one reason for this lack of success may be that the probabilistic methodology itself is often inappropriate to the clinical problems or opaque to the user. We contrast the statistical and "knowledge-based" paradigms, with an emphasis on their different approaches to the manipulation and explanation of uncertainty. A statistical application to the diagnosis of "dyspepsia" is described, in which data are obtained by computer interview of the patient, and both diseases and symptoms form a hierarchy. We argue that the flekible use of "weights of evidence" overcomes many of the previous criticisms of statistical systems while retaining a valid probabilistic output. We conclude by discussing the complementary roles of deductive and probabilistic reasoning.},

Disadvantages and barriers relating to resource and expertise, negotiating collaboration, and software requirements are also discussed. At the outset, reviewers should consider the methodological factors likely to influence results in their particular review setting, together with time and resource constraints, so that an active decision can be made about whether to extract data from published reports, collect additional or replacement summary data from trialists, or collect IPD.},

These methods are illustrated in a case study with patients suffering from traumatic brain injury, where we aim to predict 6‐month mortality based on individual patient data using meta‐analytic techniques (15 studies,               n               ~=~11\,022 patients).

  abstract     = {Summary             Amphotericin B (AB) deoxycholate is highly effective in antimony refractory cases for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Bihar. But the need for prolonged hospitalisation and frequent, occasionally serious, adverse events are its major drawbacks. Lipid formulations of AB are devoid of these problems, but very expensive. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of a commercial standardised amphotericin B emulsion, a product of AB formulated in lipid emulsion vehicle (ABLE) in the treatment of Indian VL. In this open label, non‐comparative study, 15 patients in each group were given three daily intravenous infusions each of 3, 4 or 5{$\quad$}mg/kg. All 45 patients (15 in each group) completed the treatment. The drug was tolerated well. Infusion reactions occurred in 5 (11\%) patients and vomiting in 2 (4.4\%). No nephrotoxicity or other organ toxicity was observed. At the end of treatment all patients of every group were clinically and parasitologically cured. However, during 6 months follow up, three patients from the 5{$\quad$}mg/kg group and one from the 4{$\quad$}mg/kg group tested positive for splenic aspirate. Thus 41 (91.1\%; 95\% CI 78–97) of 45 patients were cured with a total dose ranging between 9 and 15{$\quad$}mg/kg. There was no dose response linear correlation. In this preliminary study, AB formulated in a lipid emulsion vehicle was safe and effective for the treatment of VL in India.           ,              Le deoxycholate d’amphotéricine B (AB) est très efficace dans les cas réfractaires à l’antimoine pour le traitement de la leishmaniose viscérale (LV) à Bihar. Mais la nécessité d’une hospitalisation prolongée et fréquente, parfois grave et les effets indésirables sont des inconvénients majeurs. Les formulations lipidiques d’AB sont dépourvues de ces problèmes, mais sont très coûteuses. Nous avons évalué la sécurité et l’efficacité d’une émulsion commerciale standardisée d’AB, un produit à base d’AB formulé dans un véhicule àémulsion lipidique pour le traitement de la LV indienne. Dans cette étude ouverte, non comparative, 15 patients dans chaque groupe ont reçu trois perfusions intraveineuses quotidiennes contenant chacune 3, 4 ou 5{$\quad$}mg/kg. Tous les 45 patients (15 dans chaque groupe) ont complété le traitement. Le médicament était bien toléré. Des réactions liées à la perfusion ont eu lieu chez 5 (11\%) et des vomissements chez 2 (4,4\%) patients. Aucune néphrotoxicité ou des toxicités dans d’autres organes n’ont été observées. À la fin du traitement tous les patients de chaque groupe étaient cliniquement et parasitologiquement guéris. Cependant, 6 mois après, 3 patients du groupe ayant reçu 5{$\quad$}mg/kg et 1 du groupe à 4{$\quad$}mg/kg ont été testés positifs pour l’aspiration de la rate. Ainsi, 41 (91,1\%; IC95\%: 78–97) des 45 patients ont été guéris avec une dose totale comprise entre 9–15{$\quad$}mg/kg. Il n’y avait pas de corrélation dose‐réponse linéaire. Dans cette étude préliminaire, l’AB formulé dans un véhicule àémulsion lipidique s’est avérée sûre et efficace pour le traitement de la LV en Inde.           ,              La amfotericina B (AB) desoxicolato es altamente efectiva en casos de Leishmaniasis Visceral (LV) refractarios al tratamiento con antimonia en Bihar. Pero la necesidad de hospitalización prolongada y efectos adversos frecuentes, y ocasionalmente serios, son los principales inconvenientes. Las formulaciones lipídicas de AB están exentas de estos problemas, pero son muy caras. Hemos evaluado la seguridad y la eficacia de una emulsión comercial estandarizada de Amfotericina B, un producto de ABformulado en un vehículo de emulsión lipídico (ABEL) para el tratamiento de la LV hindú. En este estudio abierto, no comparativo, se les dio a 15 pacientes de cada grupo tres infusiones intravenosas diarias, cada una de 3, 4 o 5{$\quad$}mg/kg. Los 45 pacientes (15 en cada grupo) completaron el tratamiento. El medicamento fue bien tolerado. En 5 (11\%) pacientes ocurrió una reacción a la infusión y 2 (4.4\%) tuvieron vómitos. No se observó nefrotoxicidad o toxicidad en otro órgano. Al final del tratamiento, todos los pacientes de cada grupo estaban clínica y parasitológicamente curados. Sin embargo, trás 6 meses, 3 pacientes del grupo de 5{$\quad$}mg/kg y 1 del grupo de 4{$\quad$}mg/kg dió positivo para el aspirado esplénico. Por lo tanto 41 (91.1\%; 95\% IC 78–97) de los 45 pacientes se curaron con rangos de dosis totales de 9–15{$\quad$}mg/kg. No se observó una correlación linear dosis‐respuesta. En este estudio preliminar, el AB formulado con un vehículo de emulsión lipídica fue seguro y efectivo para el tratamiento de LV en India.},

In this study, we used a higher-dose regimen of an indigenously manufactured liposomal amphotericin B (FUNGISOME; L-AmBL), which was intended to improve the efficacy in terms of long-lasting cure rate. Thirty men and thirty women between 12 and 60 years old with parasitologically confirmed visceral leishmaniasis were enrolled in two cohorts of 15 patients each. Subjects in cohort I were administered one dose (10 mg/kg body weight) of L-AmBL intravenously. After the safety at this dose was confirmed in cohort I, patients were recruited in cohort II. They received one infusion of an escalated dose (15 mg/kg body weight). The safety of these two doses was evaluated over a period of 30 days, and efficacy was assessed for initial cure at day 30 and definitive cure at 6 months. FUNGISOME was found to be safe, with an initial cure rate of 100\% at day 30 and a definitive cure rate of 93.3\% at the 6-month follow-up in both the cohorts.},

  abstract     = {A clinical prediction model is a tool for predicting healthcare outcomes, usually within a specific population and context. A common approach is to develop a new clinical prediction model for each population and context; however, this wastes potentially useful historical information. A better approach is to update or incorporate the existing clinical prediction models already developed for use in similar contexts or populations. In addition, clinical prediction models commonly become miscalibrated over time, and need replacing or updating. In this article, we review a range of approaches for re-using and updating clinical prediction models; these fall in into three main categories: simple coefficient updating, combining multiple previous clinical prediction models in a meta-model and dynamic updating of models. We evaluated the performance (discrimination and calibration) of the different strategies using data on mortality following cardiac surgery in the United Kingdom: We found that no single strategy performed sufficiently well to be used to the exclusion of the others. In conclusion, useful tools exist for updating existing clinical prediction models to a new population or context, and these should be implemented rather than developing a new clinical prediction model from scratch, using a breadth of complementary statistical methods.},

Here, we follow cohorts of VL patients with or without HIV in Ethiopia. By the end of the study, 78.1\% of VL/HIV—but none of the VL patients—experience VL relapse. Despite a clinically defined cure, VL/HIV patients maintain higher parasite loads, lower BMI, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia. We identify three immunological markers associated with VL relapse in VL/HIV patients: (1) failure to restore antigen-specific production of IFN-g, (2) persistently lower CD4+ T cell counts, and (3) higher expression of PD1 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We show that these three markers, which can be measured in primary hospital settings in Ethiopia, combine well in predicting VL relapse. The use of our prediction model has the potential to improve disease management and patient care.},

  abstract     = {Background.{$\quad$} To expedite the development of new oral treatment regimens for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), there is a need for early markers to evaluate treatment response and predict long-term outcomes. Methods.{$\quad$} Data from 3 clinical trials were combined in this study, in which Eastern African VL patients received various antileishmanial therapies. Leishmania kinetoplast DNA was quantified in whole blood with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) before, during, and up to 6 months after treatment. The predictive performance of pharmacodynamic parameters for clinical relapse was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic curves. Clinical trial simulations were performed to determine the power associated with the use of blood parasite load as a surrogate endpoint to predict clinical outcome at 6 months. Results.{$\quad$} The absolute parasite density on day 56 after start of treatment was found to be a highly sensitive predictor of relapse within 6 months of follow-up at a cutoff of 20 parasites/mL (area under the curve 0.92, specificity 0.91, sensitivity 0.89). Blood parasite loads correlated well with tissue parasite loads (ρ\>=\> 0.80) and with microscopy gradings of bone marrow and spleen aspirate smears. Clinical trial simulations indicated a {$>$} 80\% power to detect a difference in cure rate between treatment regimens if this difference was high ({$>$} 50\%) and when minimally 30 patients were included per regimen. Conclusions.{$\quad$}Blood Leishmania parasite load determined by qPCR is a promising early biomarker to predict relapse in VL patients. Once optimized, it might be useful in dose finding studies of new chemical entities.},

  abstract     = {Background: A possible strategy to reduce fatality rates of visceral leishmaniasis is to identify prognostic factors that can be easily assessed and used as an aid to clinical decision-making. Patients and Methods: A case-control study was developed in Teresina, Brazil, in which cases were patients who died during treatment (n = 12) and controls (n = 78) comprised a random sample of patients who were alive when treatment was finished. Results: Variables significantly associated with death were severe anemia, fever for more than 60 days, diarrhea and jaundice. The prognostic system had a sensitivity of 85.7\% and a specificity of 92.5\%. Conclusion: The prognostic model developed in this study had satisfactory performance and might be useful in developing countries, since it is simple and inexpensive. However, it is still preliminary and needs to be improved and validated using larger and more recent samples.},

  abstract   = {Background Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease prevalent in populations affected by poverty and poor nutrition. Without treatment, death is the norm. Prognostic models can steer important management decisions by identifying patients at high-risk of adverse outcomes. We therefore aim to identify, summarise, and appraise the available prognostic models predicting clinical outcomes in VL patients. Methods We reviewed all published studies that developed, validated, or updated models predicting clinical outcomes in VL patients. Five bibliographic databases were searched from database inception to March 1st 2023 with no language restriction. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed in duplicate. Findings are presented with tables, figures, and a narrative review. Results Eight studies, published 2003-21, were identified describing 12 model developments and 19 external validations. All models predicted either in-hospital mortality (n=10 models) or registry-reported mortality (n=2), and were developed in either Brazilian or East African settings (n=9 and n=3 models respectively). Model discrimination (c-statistic) ranged from 0.62-0.92 when evaluated in new data (19 external validations, 10 models). Risk of bias was high for all model developments and validations: no studies presented calibration plots, 11 models were at high risk of overfitting due to small sample sizes, and six models presented risk scores that were inconsistent with reported regression coefficients. Conclusion With a high risk of bias identified for all models, caution must be exercised when interpreting model predictions and performance measures. Prior to model development or validation, we encourage investigators to review model reporting guidelines. No prognostic models were identified predicting treatment failure or relapse. Furthermore, despite South Asia representing the highest VL burden pre-2010, no models were developed in this population. In the context of the current South Asia elimination programme, these represent important evidence gaps where new model development should be prioritised.},

  abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease responsible for many thousands of preventable deaths each year. Symptomatic patients often struggle to access effective treatment, without which death is the norm. Risk prediction tools support clinical teams and policymakers in identifying high-risk patients who could benefit from more intensive management pathways. Investigators interested in using their clinical data for prognostic research should first identify currently available models that are candidates for validation and possible updating. Addressing these needs, we aim to identify, summarise and appraise the available models predicting clinical outcomes in VL patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will include studies that have developed, validated or updated prognostic models predicting future clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with VL. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses that include eligible studies are also considered for review. Conference abstracts and educational theses are excluded. Data extraction, appraisal and reporting will follow current methodological guidelines. Ovid Embase; Ovid MEDLINE; the Web of Science Core Collection, SciELO and LILACS are searched from database inception to 1 March 2023 using terms developed for the identification of prediction models, and with no language restriction. Screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be performed in duplicate with discordance resolved by a third independent reviewer. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST). Tables and figures will compare and contrast key model information, including source data, participants, model development and performance measures, and risk of bias. We will consider the strengths, limitations and clinical applicability of the identified models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required for this review. The systematic review and all accompanying data will be submitted to an open-access journal. Findings will also be disseminated through the research group's website (www.iddo.org/research-themes/visceral-leishmaniasis) and social media channels.

  abstract     = {Clinical risk prediction models are increasingly being developed and validated on multicenter datasets. In this article, we present a comprehensive framework for the evaluation of the predictive performance of prediction models at the center level and the population level, considering population-averaged predictions, center-specific predictions, and predictions assuming an average random center effect. We demonstrated in a simulation study that calibration slopes do not only deviate from one because of over- or underfitting of patterns in the development dataset, but also as a result of the choice of the model (standard versus mixed effects logistic regression), the type of predictions (marginal versus conditional versus assuming an average random effect), and the level of model validation (center versus population). In particular, when data is heavily clustered (ICC 20\%), center-specific predictions offer the best predictive performance at the population level and the center level. We recommend that models should reflect the data structure, while the level of model validation should reflect the research question.},

Data sources               PubMed and Embase through Ovid, up to 17 February 2021, supplemented with arXiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 5 May 2020.                                         Study selection               Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model.                                         Data extraction               At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool).                                         Results                                126\,978 titles were screened, and 412 studies describing 731 new prediction models or validations were included. Of these 731, 125 were diagnostic models (including 75 based on medical imaging) and the remaining 606 were prognostic models for either identifying those at risk of covid-19 in the general population (13 models) or predicting diverse outcomes in those individuals with confirmed covid-19 (593 models). Owing to the widespread availability of diagnostic testing capacity after the summer of 2020, this living review has now focused on the prognostic models. Of these, 29 had low risk of bias, 32 had unclear risk of bias, and 545 had high risk of bias. The most common causes for high risk of bias were inadequate sample sizes (n=408, 67\%) and inappropriate or incomplete evaluation of model performance (n=338, 56\%). 381 models were newly developed, and 225 were external validations of existing models. The reported C indexes varied between 0.77 and 0.93 in development studies with low risk of bias, and between 0.56 and 0.78 in external validations with low risk of bias. The Qcovid models, the PRIEST score, Carr’s model, the ISARIC4C Deterioration model, and the Xie model showed adequate predictive performance in studies at low risk of bias. Details on all reviewed models are publicly available at                 https://www.covprecise.org/                 .                                                        Conclusion               Prediction models for covid-19 entered the academic literature to support medical decision making at unprecedented speed and in large numbers. Most published prediction model studies were poorly reported and at high risk of bias such that their reported predictive performances are probably optimistic. Models with low risk of bias should be validated before clinical implementation, preferably through collaborative efforts to also allow an investigation of the heterogeneity in their performance across various populations and settings. Methodological guidance, as provided in this paper, should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, prediction modellers should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.

  abstract     = {The use of data from multiple studies or centers for the validation of a clinical test or a multivariable prediction model allows researchers to investigate the test's/model's performance in multiple settings and populations. Recently, meta‐analytic techniques have been proposed to summarize discrimination and calibration across study populations. Here, we rather consider performance in terms of net benefit, which is a measure of clinical utility that weighs the benefits of true positive classifications against the harms of false positives. We posit that it is important to examine clinical utility across multiple settings of interest. This requires a suitable meta‐analysis method, and we propose a Bayesian trivariate random‐effects meta‐analysis of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence. Across a range of chosen harm‐to‐benefit ratios, this provides a summary measure of net benefit, a prediction interval, and an estimate of the probability that the test/model is clinically useful in a new setting. In addition, the prediction interval and probability of usefulness can be calculated conditional on the known prevalence in a new setting. The proposed methods are illustrated by 2 case studies: one on the meta‐analysis of published studies on ear thermometry to diagnose fever in children and one on the validation of a multivariable clinical risk prediction model for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in a multicenter dataset. Crucially, in both case studies the clinical utility of the test/model was heterogeneous across settings, limiting its usefulness in practice. This emphasizes that heterogeneity in clinical utility should be assessed before a test/model is routinely implemented.},

  abstract     = {Objectives               The ability to efficiently and accurately predict future risk of primary total hip and knee replacement (THR/TKR) in earlier stages of osteoarthritis (OA) has potentially important applications. We aimed to develop and validate two models to estimate an individual’s risk of primary THR and TKR in patients newly presenting to primary care.                                         Methods               We identified two cohorts of patients aged ≥40 years newly consulting hip pain/OA and knee pain/OA in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Candidate predictors were identified by systematic review, novel hypothesis-free ‘Record-Wide Association Study’ with replication, and panel consensus. Cox proportional hazards models accounting for competing risk of death were applied to derive risk algorithms for THR and TKR. Internal–external cross-validation (IECV) was then applied over geographical regions to validate two models.                                         Results               45 predictors for THR and 53 for TKR were identified, reviewed and selected by the panel. 301 052 and 416 030 patients newly consulting between 1992 and 2015 were identified in the hip and knee cohorts, respectively (median follow-up 6 years). The resultant model C-statistics is 0.73 (0.72, 0.73) and 0.79 (0.78, 0.79) for THR (with 20 predictors) and TKR model (with 24 predictors), respectively. The IECV C-statistics ranged between 0.70–0.74 (THR model) and 0.76–0.82 (TKR model); the IECV calibration slope ranged between 0.93–1.07 (THR model) and 0.92–1.12 (TKR model).                                         Conclusions               Two prediction models with good discrimination and calibration that estimate individuals’ risk of THR and TKR have been developed and validated in large-scale, nationally representative data, and are readily automated in electronic patient records.},

  abstract = {Background Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease prevalent in populations affected by poverty and poor nutrition. Without treatment, death is the norm. Prognostic models can steer important management decisions by identifying patients at high-risk of adverse outcomes. We therefore aim to identify, summarise, and appraise the available prognostic models predicting clinical outcomes in VL patients. Methods We reviewed all published studies that developed, validated, or updated models predicting clinical outcomes in VL patients. Five bibliographic databases were searched from database inception to March 1st 2023 with no language restriction. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed in duplicate. Findings are presented with tables, figures, and a narrative review. Results Eight studies, published 2003-21, were identified describing 12 model developments and 19 external validations. All models predicted either in-hospital mortality (n=10 models) or registry-reported mortality (n=2), and were developed in either Brazilian or East African settings (n=9 and n=3 models respectively). Model discrimination (c--statistic) ranged from 0.62-0.92 when evaluated in new data (19 external validations, 10 models). Risk of bias was high for all model developments and validations: no studies presented calibration plots, 11 models were at high risk of overfitting due to small sample sizes, and six models presented risk scores that were inconsistent with reported regression coefficients. Conclusion With a high risk of bias identified for all models, caution must be exercised when interpreting model predictions and performance measures. Prior to model development or validation, we encourage investigators to review model reporting guidelines. No prognostic models were identified predicting treatment failure or relapse. Furthermore, despite South Asia representing the highest VL burden pre-2010, no models were developed in this population. In the context of the current South Asia elimination programme, these represent important evidence gaps where new model development should be prioritised.},

The purpose of the guideline is to improve the diagnosis of anaemia, grounded in gender, equity and human rights approaches, with the aim of leaving no one behind, thereby informing the development of nutrition and health policies. The normative statements in this guideline are intended for a wide audience, including policy-makers, their expert advisers, and technical and programme staff at ministries and organizations involved in the design, implementation, and scaling-up of actions for addressing anaemia. Other end-users of the guideline include nongovernmental and other organizations and professional societies involved in the planning and management of anaemia actions, as well as health professionals including clinicians, managers of nutrition and health programmes, national blood services, and public health policy-makers in all settings},

There are few available treatments and antimonials are still of major importance in the therapeutic strategies used in most endemic regions. However, resistance toward these compounds has recently emerged in areas where the replacement of these drugs is mainly limited by the cost of alternative molecules. In this paper, we reviewed the studies carried out on antimonial resistance in                Leishmania                . Several common limitations of these works are presented before prevalent approaches to evidence antimonial resistance are related. Afterwards, phenotypic determination of resistance is described, then confronted to clinical outcome. Finally, we detail molecular mechanisms and targets involved in resistance and already identified                in vitro                within selected mutant strains or in clinical isolates.},

We observed a large range of parasitemias, more than 9 log values, and could determine the threshold between asymptomatic carriage and disease in the Mediterranean area (approximately one parasite/mL of blood). Based on kinetoplast DNA amplification, this assay had a sensitivity of 0.001 parasite DNA equivalents/mL and detected asymptomatic carriage of Leishmania. It detected parasite DNA in 58% of healthy subjects, while an immunoblot detected specific antibodies in only 16%. For initial diagnosis of disease, this quantitative PCR with blood samples constitutes a non-invasive alternative to bone marrow aspiration. Its main applications are monitoring of drug therapy and follow-up of immunodeficient patients for biologic confirmation of relapses.},

  abstract   = {Clinical risk prediction models are increasingly being developed and validated on multicenter datasets. In this article, we present a comprehensive framework for the evaluation of the predictive performance of prediction models at the center level and the population level, considering population-averaged predictions, center-specific predictions, and predictions assuming an average random center effect. We demonstrated in a simulation study that calibration slopes do not only deviate from one because of over- or underfitting of patterns in the development dataset, but also as a result of the choice of the model (standard versus mixed effects logistic regression), the type of predictions (marginal versus conditional versus assuming an average random effect), and the level of model validation (center versus population). In particular, when data is heavily clustered (ICC 20\%), center-specific predictions offer the best predictive performance at the population level and the center level. We recommend that models should reflect the data structure, while the level of model validation should reflect the research question.},
