An often cited `rule of thumb' is that at least 10--20 outcome events per predictor parameter (EPP) are required to prevent model overfitting\cite{peduzzi1996,harrell2015}. Over the past two decades, however, both the validity of this threshold and the broader premise that a single rule applies universally have been increasingly questioned in the prediction modelling literature\cite{courvoisier2011}.

In response to these concerns, Riley et al.\cite{riley2019A} proposed a new sample size methodology in 2018. For prediction models with binary or time--to--event outcomes, the approach defines a minimum sample size that satisfies three criteria: (i) minimal optimism in predictor effect estimates, quantified by a global shrinkage factor of $\geq$0.9; (ii) a small absolute difference ($\leq$0.05) between the model's apparent and adjusted Nagelkerke's R\textsuperscript{2}; and (iii) precise estimation of the overall population risk (i.e.\ the model intercept). When the number of participants and outcome events is fixed, as in the present study, the maximum allowable EPP can be derived from an estimate of the model's overall performance. In the absence of previously published prediction models for relapse, we followed the authors' recommendation and assumed a Nagelkerke R\textsuperscript{2} of 0.15\cite{riley2019A}.

This methodology has been implemented in the \texttt{pmsampsize} R package\cite{ensor2023}, which was used to perform the sample size calculations for this study.

\subsubsection{ISC model}

With a total of 228 relapses identified among 4,599 participants (5.0\% event rate), the maximum number of predictor parameters satisfying Riley et al.'s three criteria was 25, corresponding to 8.86 events per predictor parameter (EPP). Relaxing the permitted overall shrinkage from 0.90 to 0.85 (modifying criteria (i)) allows for 40 predictor parameters, corresponding to 5.57 EPP.

\subsubsection{East Africa model}

With a total of 99 relapses identified among 2,051 participants (4.8\% event rate), the maximum number of predictor parameters satisfying Riley et al.'s three criteria was 11, corresponding to 8.81 EPP. Relaxing the permitted overall shrinkage from 0.90 to 0.85 (modifying criteria (i)) allows for 18 predictor parameters, corresponding to 5.54 EPP.
